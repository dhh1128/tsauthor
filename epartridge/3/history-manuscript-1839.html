In presenting to our readers a history of the persecutions of XXCHURCHFULL in
the State of XXSTATE we feel it our duty to commence it at the beginning,
notwithstanding many of our readers we are aware are well acquainted with the
outrages committed in XXCOUNTY (an account of them having been published in
the Evening & Morning star) and might perhaps rather see the paper filled with
other matter than to have those former troubles presented before them again.
yet there are a great many others, who are altogether unacquainted with those
early persecutions who would feel that we had not done our duty were we to
pass by them and confine our history to more recent transactions. Thus much by
way of introduction. In the winter of A.D. XXYEAR-XXYEAR five elders of the
church of XXJESUSCHRIST XXNUMBER of which were from the State of N. York State and
one was from XXSTATE traveled through a deep snow which is not common in that
country through the prairies from XXCITY to XXCOUNTY XXSTATE where they made a
permanent stand. They occasionally preached about the country as the way
opened before them. A few believed the gospel preached and had been baptized
when About the middle of the following XXMONTH a number more elders’ arrived
at XXCOUNTY, and shortly after a small branch of the church also arrived. At
that time there appeared to be but little objection to our people’s settling
there, although the preaching had stirred up some few to appear like hedge
hogs when an enemy is near. The church in XXCOUNTY continued to increase
continually until it was driven from the Co.. As the church increased the
hostile spirit of the people increased also. The enemies circulated from time
to time all manner of false stories against our people hoping thereby to stir
up the indignation of others. They also in the spring of XXYEAR brick batted
or stoned some of the houses of the Saints breaking in windows etc not only
disturbing but endangering the lives of the inmates. In the course of that
season a county meeting was called at Independence to adopt measures to drive
the Saints from the County but the meeting broke up without coming to any
agreement about the Saints having had too much confusion among themselves to
do more than to have a few knock downs after taking a plentiful supply of
whiskey.

The result of this meeting may be attributed in part to the influence of
certain patriotic individuals among whom Gen Clark a Sub Indian agent may be
considered as principal, he hearing of the meeting came from his agency or
home some XXNUMBER or XXNUMBER miles distant, a day or two before the meeting. He appeared
quite indignant at the idea of having the Constitution and laws trodden under
foot, by the strong trampling upon the weak. He went to certain influential
mob characters and offered to decide our case with them in single combat. He
said that it would be better for one or two individuals to die than for
hundreds to be put to death.

Although the meeting had broken up without doing any thing, yet the hostile
spirit of individuals was no less abated. Such was their thirst for the
destruction of the Saints that they, that same fall, shot into the houses of
certain individuals. One ball in particular lodged in a log near the head of
the owner of the house as he lay in bed.

During the winter and Spring of XXYEAR the mob spirit spread itself though in
a measure secretly, but in the forepart of summer it began to show itself
openly in the stoning of houses and other insults. Some time in XXMONTH the
unparalleled declaration of the people of XXCOUNTY made its appearance. in
which they seemed to have tried their best to defame our people charging them
with crime at the same time they acknowledged that the laws of the land would
not reach our people, which was evidently the case, for they held the reins of
goverment or in other words had the administering of the laws in their own
hands and could they have found the law broken even in a single instance who
does not know that they would have put the in force, and thereby substantiated
their charges, against the saints, which they never did, in preference to
taking unlawful measures against them. The following remarkable sentence is
near the close of their famous declaration "..." The 20th of XXMONTH was the
day set for the people to come together and commence their work of
destruction-- Accordingly they met to the number of XXNUMBER or XXNUMBER a committee of XXNUMBER
of the mob requested an interview with some of the principal elders of the
church-- XXNUMBER were soon called together who met the mob committee. They demanded
of our people to have the printing office and indeed all other mechanic’s
shops together with XXLASTNAME & XXLASTNAME’s (store) closed forthwith and the
society to agree to leave the Co. immediately. Our elders asked XXNUMBER months for
consideration which being refused they asked for XXNUMBER days when they were
informed that XXNUMBER minutes were the most that could be granted, being driven to
the necessity of giving an immediate answer they said that they could not
consent to their demands upon which one of the mob observed, as he left the
room, that he was sorry for now the work of destruction would commence
immediately. In a short time hundreds of the mob gathered around the printing
office (which was a two story brick building) which they soon threw down-- The
press was thrown from the loft and The book work, paper, type, aparatus etc
scattered around.-- After destroying the printing establishment they proceeded
to Gilberts store for the same purpose
