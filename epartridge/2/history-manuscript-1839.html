In presenting to our readers a history of the persecutions of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter day-Saints in the State of Missouri we feel it our duty
to commence it at the beginning, notwithstanding many of our readers we are
aware are well acquainted with the outrages committed in Jackson County (an
account of them having been published in the Evening & Morning star) and might
perhaps rather see the paper filled with other matter than to have those
former troubles presented before them again. yet there are a great many
others, who are altogether unacquainted with those early persecutions who
would feel that we had not done our duty were we to pass by them and confine
our history to more recent transactions. Thus much by way of introduction. In
the winter of A.D. 1830-31 five elders of the church of Jesus Christ 4 of
which were from the State of N. York State and one was from Ohio traveled
through a deep snow which is not common in that country through the prairies
from St Louis to Jackson Co. Missouri where they made a permanent stand. They
occasionally preached about the country as the way opened before them. A few
believed the gospel preached and had been baptized when About the middle of
the following July a number more elders’ arrived at Jackson Co., and shortly
after a small branch of the church also arrived. At that time there appeared
to be but little objection to our people’s settling there, although the
preaching had stirred up some few to appear like hedge hogs when an enemy is
near. The church in Jackson Co. continued to increase continually until it was
driven from the Co.. As the church increased the hostile spirit of the people
increased also. The enemies circulated from time to time all manner of false
stories against our people hoping thereby to stir up the indignation of
others. They also in the spring of 1832 brick batted or stoned some of the
houses of the Saints breaking in windows etc not only disturbing but
endangering the lives of the inmates. In the course of that season a county
meeting was called at Independence to adopt measures to drive the Saints from
the County but the meeting broke up without coming to any agreement about the
Saints having had too much confusion among themselves to do more than to have
a few knock downs after taking a plentiful supply of whiskey.

The result of this meeting may be attributed in part to the influence of
certain patriotic individuals among whom Gen Clark a Sub Indian agent may be
considered as principal, he hearing of the meeting came from his agency or
home some 30 or 40 miles distant, a day or two before the meeting. He appeared
quite indignant at the idea of having the Constitution and laws trodden under
foot, by the strong trampling upon the weak. He went to certain influential
mob characters and offered to decide our case with them in single combat. He
said that it would be better for one or two individuals to die than for
hundreds to be put to death.

Although the meeting had broken up without doing any thing, yet the hostile
spirit of individuals was no less abated. Such was their thirst for the
destruction of the Saints that they, that same fall, shot into the houses of
certain individuals. One ball in particular lodged in a log near the head of
the owner of the house as he lay in bed.

During the winter and Spring of 1833 the mob spirit spread itself though in a
measure secretly, but in the forepart of summer it began to show itself openly
in the stoning of houses and other insults. Some time in July the unparalleled
declaration of the people of Jackson Co. made its appearance. in which they
seemed to have tried their best to defame our people charging them with crime
at the same time they acknowledged that the laws of the land would not reach
our people, which was evidently the case, for they held the reins of goverment
or in other words had the administering of the laws in their own hands and
could they have found the law broken even in a single instance who does not
know that they would have put the in force, and thereby substantiated their
charges, against the saints, which they never did, in preference to taking
unlawful measures against them. The following remarkable sentence is near the
close of their famous declaration "..." The 20th of July was the day set for
the people to come together and commence their work of destruction--
Accordingly they met to the number of 3 or 400 a committee of 13 of the mob
requested an interview with some of the principal elders of the church-- 6
were soon called together who met the mob committee. They demanded of our
people to have the printing office and indeed all other mechanic’s shops
together with Gilbert & Whitney’s (store) closed forthwith and the society
to agree to leave the Co. immediately. Our elders asked 3 months for
consideration which being refused they asked for 10 days when they were
informed that 15 minutes were the most that could be granted, being driven to
the necessity of giving an immediate answer they said that they could not
consent to their demands upon which one of the mob observed, as he left the
room, that he was sorry for now the work of destruction would commence
immediately. In a short time hundreds of the mob gathered around the printing
office (which was a two story brick building) which they soon threw down-- The
press was thrown from the loft and The book work, paper, type, aparatus etc
scattered around.-- After destroying the printing establishment they proceeded
to Gilberts store for the same purpose
