My Dear and beloved wife I received a letter from Hyrum which cheered my heart
to learn that my family was all alive yet my heart mourns for those who have
been taken from us but not without hope for I shall see them again and be with
them therefore we can be more reconciled to the dealings of God I am no making
all haste to arrange my business to start for home I feel very anxious to see
you all once more in this world the time seems long that I am deprived of your
society but the Lord being my helper I will not be much longer I am determined
to start for home in a few days our business I expect is before the house of
Congress now and I shall start for Washington in a few days and from there
home as soon as possible I am filled with constant anxiety and shall be until
I get home I pray God to spare you all until I get home my dear Emma my heart
is entwined around you and those little ones I want you to remember me tell
all the children that I love them and will come home as soon as I can yours in
the bonds of love yoru husband until death etc
