Dear Wife
</p>

<p>
I would inform you that Brother XXFIRSTNAME has arrived here and brought the
pleasing news that our families were well when he left there which greatly
cheered our hearts and revived our spirits. We thank our Heavenly Father for
his goodness unto us and all of you. XXFIRSTNAME arrived on Saturday the same
week he left Chagrin having a prosperous time. We are all in good health.
Brother XXLASTNAMEâ€™s leg is gaining and he thinks he shall be able to
perform his journey so as to get home about the 20th. My situation is a very
unpleasant one although I will endeavor to be contented, the Lord assisting
me. I have visited a grove which is just back of the town almost every day
where I can be secluded from the eyes of any mortal and there give vent to all
the feelings of my heart in meditation and prayer. I have called to mind all
the past moments of my life and am left to mourn and shed tears of sorrow for
my folly in suffering the adversary of my soul to have so much power over me
as he has had in times past, but God is merciful and has forgiven my sins, and
I rejoice that he sendeth forth the comforter unto as many as believe and
humbleth themselves before Him. I was grieved to hear that XXFIRSTNAME had
lost his little child. I think we can in some degree sympathize with him but
we all must be reconciled to our lots and say the will of the Lord be done.
Sister XXLASTNAME wrote a letter to her husband which was very cheering and
being unwell at that time and filled with much anxiety it would have been very
consoling to me to have received a few lines from you, but as you did not take
the trouble I will try to be contented with my lot, knowing that God is my
friend. In him I shall find comfort. I have given my life into his hands. I am
prepared to go at his call
