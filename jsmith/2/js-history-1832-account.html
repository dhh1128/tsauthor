<p>
I was born in the town of Sharon in the state of Vermont North America on the
</p>

<p>
twenty third day of December AD 1805 of goodly Parents who spared no pains to
</p>

<p>
instruct me in the christian religion. At the age of about ten years my Father
</p>

<p>
Joseph Smith Senior moved to Palmyra Ontario County in the State of New York
</p>

<p>
and being in indigent circumstances were obliged to labor hard for the support
</p>

<p>
of a large Family having nine children and as it required their exertions of
</p>

<p>
all that were able to render any assistance for the support of the family,
</p>

<p>
therefore we were deprived of the benefit of an education. Suffice it to say I
</p>

<p>
was merely instructed in reading and writing and the ground rules of
</p>

<p>
Arithmetic which constituted my whole literary acquirements. At about the age
</p>

<p>
of twelve years my mind become seriously impressed with regard to the all
</p>

<p>
important concerns for the welfare of my immortal Soul which led me to
</p>

<p>
searching the scriptures--believing, as I was taught, that they contained the
</p>

<p>
word of God. Thus applying myself to them and my intimate acquaintance with
</p>

<p>
those of different denominations led me to marvel exceedingly, for I
</p>

<p>
discovered that instead of adorning their profession by a holy walk and Godly
</p>

<p>
conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository.
</p>

<p>
This was a grief to my Soul. Thus from the age of twelve years to fifteen I
</p>

<p>
pondered many things in my heart concerning the situation of the world of
</p>

<p>
mankind: the contentions and divisions the wickedness and abominations and the
</p>

<p>
darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind. My mind became exceedingly
</p>

<p>
distressed for I become convicted of my sins, and by searching the scriptures
</p>

<p>
I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized
</p>

<p>
from the true and living faith and there was no society or denomination that
</p>

<p>
built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament and I
</p>

<p>
felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world. For I learned in
</p>

<p>
the scriptures that God was the same yesterday to day and forever that he was
</p>

<p>
no respecter to persons for he was God. For I looked upon the sun the glorious
</p>

<p>
luminary of the earth and also the moon rolling in their majesty through the
</p>

<p>
heavens and also the stars shining in their courses and the earth also upon
</p>

<p>
which I stood and the beast of the field and the fowls of heaven and the fish
</p>

<p>
of the waters and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty
</p>

<p>
and in the strength of beauty whose power and intelligence in governing the
</p>

<p>
things which are so exceeding great and marvelous even in the likeness of him
</p>

<p>
who created them and when I considered upon these things my heart exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
well hath the wise man said the fool saith in his heart there is no God. My
</p>

<p>
heart exclaimed, all, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and
</p>

<p>
omnipresent power a being who maketh Laws and decreeth and bindeth all things
</p>

<p>
in their bounds who filleth Eternity who was and is and will be from all
</p>

<p>
Eternity to Eternity and when I considered all these things and that that
</p>

<p>
being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth
</p>

<p>
therefore I cried unto the Lord for mercy for there was none else to whom I
</p>

<p>
could go and to obtain mercy and the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness and
</p>

<p>
while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord in the 16th year of my age a
</p>

<p>
pillar of fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day come down
</p>

<p>
from above and rested upon me and I was filled with the spirit of god and the
</p>

<p>
Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying
</p>

<p>
Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee. go thy way walk in my statutes and
</p>

<p>
keep my commandments behold I am the Lord of glory I was crucified for the
</p>

<p>
world that all those who believe on my name may have Eternal life. Behold the
</p>

<p>
world lieth in sin and at this time and none doeth good no not one they have
</p>

<p>
turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments they draw near to me
</p>

<p>
with their lips while their hearts are far from me and mine anger is kindling
</p>

<p>
against the inhabitants of the earth to visit them according to their
</p>

<p>
ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of
</p>

<p>
the prophets and Apostles. Behold and lo I come quickly as it is written of
</p>

<p>
me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father. And my soul was filled
</p>

<p>
with love and for many days I could rejoice with great Joy and the Lord was
</p>

<p>
with me but could find none that would believe the heavenly vision
</p>

<p>
nevertheless I pondered these things in my heart.
