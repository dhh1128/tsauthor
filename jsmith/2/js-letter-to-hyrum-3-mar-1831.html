Brother XXFIRSTNAME

We arrived here safe and are all well I have been engaged in regulating the
Churches here as the disciples are numerous and the devil has made many
attempts to overthrow them it has been a serious Job but the Lord is with us
and we have overcome and have all things reular the work is breaking forth on
the right hand and on the left and there is a great Call for Elders in this
place we have received a letter from XXFIRSTNAME dated XXCITY XXCOUNTY XXSTATE
XXMONTH the 29th XXYEAR these are the words which he has written saying ...
thus reads most of the letter.

<p>
My Dearly Beloved Brother XXFIRSTNAME
</p>

<p>
I have had much concern about you but I always remember you in my prayers
Calling upon god to keep you safe in spit of men or devils I think you had
better come into this country immediately for the Lord has commanded us that
we should call the elders of this church to gather unto this place as soon as
possible.
</p>

<p>
March forth this morning after being called out of my bed in the night to go a
small distance I went and had an awful struggle with satan but being armed
with the power of God he was cast out and the woman is clothed in her right
mind the Lord worth wonders in this land.
</p>

<p>
I want to see you all may the grace of God be and abide with you all even so
Amen
</p>

<p>
your Brother forever
