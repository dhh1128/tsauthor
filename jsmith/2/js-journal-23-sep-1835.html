This day Joseph Smith Jr. was at home writing blessings for my most beloved
brethren I have been hindered by a multitude of visitors but the Lord has
blessed our souls this day. May God grant to continue his mercies unto my
house, this night for Christ sake. This day my soul has desired the salvation
of Brother Ezra Thayer. Also Brother Noah, Packard. Came to my house and let
the Chapel Committee have one thousand dollars, by loan, for the building the
house of the Lord; Oh may God bless him with an hundred fold! even of the
things of Earth, for this righteous act. My heart is full of desire today, to
be blessed of the God, of Abraham; with prosperity, until I will be able to
pay all my debts; for it is the delight of my soul to be honest. Oh Lord that
thou knowest right well! help me and I will give to the poor.

Thsi day Brothers William, John, and Joseph Tippets started for Missouri the
place designated for Zion or the Saints gathering they came to bid us farewell
the brethren came in to pray with them and Brother David Whitmer acted as
spokesman he prayed in the spirit a glorious time succeeded his prayer Joy
filled our hearts and we blessed them and bid them Godspeed and promised them
a safe journey and took them by the hand and bid them farewell for a season
Oh! may God grand them long life and good days these blessing sI ask upon them
for Christ sake amen
