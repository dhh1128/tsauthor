I was born in the town of Sharon in the state of Vermont North America on the twenty third day of December AD 1805 of goodly Parents who spared no pains to instruct me in the christian religion. At the age of about ten years my Father Joseph Smith Senior moved to Palmyra Ontario County in the State of New York and being in indigent circumstances were obliged to labor hard for the support of a large Family having nine children and as it required their exertions of all that were able to render any assistance for the support of the family, therefore we were deprived of the benefit of an education. Suffice it to say I was merely instructed in reading and writing and the ground rules of Arithmetic which constituted my whole literary acquirements. At about the age of twelve years my mind become seriously impressed with regard to the all important concerns for the welfare of my immortal Soul which led me to searching the scriptures--believing, as I was taught, that they contained the word of God. Thus applying myself to them and my intimate acquaintance with those of different denominations led me to marvel exceedingly, for I discovered that instead of adorning their profession by a holy walk and Godly conversation agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository. This was a grief to my Soul. Thus from the age of twelve years to fifteen I pondered many things in my heart concerning the situation of the world of mankind: the contentions and divisions the wickedness and abominations and the darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind. My mind became exceedingly distressed for I become convicted of my sins, and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith and there was no society or denomination that built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the new testament and I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world. For I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday to day and forever that he was no respecter to persons for he was God. For I looked upon the sun the glorious luminary of the earth and also the moon rolling in their majesty through the heavens and also the stars shining in their courses and the earth also upon which I stood and the beast of the field and the fowls of heaven and the fish of the waters and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceeding great and marvelous even in the likeness of him who created them and when I considered upon these things my heart exclaimed, well hath the wise man said the fool saith in  his heart there is no God. My heart exclaimed, all, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power a being who maketh Laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds who filleth Eternity who was and is and will be from all Eternity to Eternity and when I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth therefore I cried unto the Lord for mercy for there was none else to whom I could go and to obtain mercy and the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord in the 16th year of my age a pillar of  fire light above the brightness of the sun at noon day  come down from above and rested upon me and I was filled  with the spirit of god and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord and he spake unto me saying  Joseph my son thy sins are forgiven thee. go thy way walk in my  statutes and keep my commandments behold I am the  Lord of glory I was crucified for the world that all those  who believe on my name may have Eternal life. Behold the world lieth in sin and at this time and none doeth good no  not one they have turned aside from the gospel and  keep not my commandments they draw near to me with their  lips while their hearts are far from me and mine anger  is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth to visit  them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and Apostles. Behold and lo I come quickly as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father. And my soul was filled with love and for many days I  could rejoice with great Joy and the Lord was with me  but could find none that would believe the heavenly vision nevertheless I pondered these things in my heart.
