Mr. Editor Sir, Considering the Liberal principles upon which your interesting
and valuable paper is published and myself being a subscriber and feeling a
deep interst in the cause of Zion and in the happiness of my brethren of
mankind I cheerfully take up my pen to contribute my mite at this very
interesting and important period.

For some length of time I have been carefully viewing the state of things as
now appear throughout our christian Land and have looked at it with feelings
of the most painful anxiety while upon the one hand beholding the manifested
withdrawal of God's holy Spirit and the veil of stupidity which seems to be
drawn over the hearts of the people, and upon the other hand beholding the
Judgments of God that have swept and are still sweeping hundreds and thousands
of our race (and I fear unprepared) down to the shades of death. With this
solemn and alarming fact before me I am led to exclaim O that my head were
waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that I might weep day and night etc.
I think that it is high time for a christian world to awake out of sleep and
cry mightily to that God day and night whose anger we have Justly incurred.
Are not these things a sufficient stimulant to arouse the faculties and call
forth the energies of every man woman and child that possesses feeling of
sympathy for his fellows or that is in any degree endeared to the budding
cause of our glorious Lord; I leave an intelligent community to answer this
important question with a confession that this is what has caused me to
overlook my own inability and expose my weakness to a learned world but
trusting in that God who has said these things are hid from the wise and
prudent and revealed unto babes I step forth into the field to tell you what
the Lord is doing and what you must do to enjoy the smiles of your saviour in
these last days—— The time has at last come arrived when the God of
Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob has set his hand again the seccond time to
recover the remnants of his people which have

been left from Assyria, and from Egypt and from Pathros &.c. and from the
Islands of the sea and with them to bring in the fulness of the Gentiles and
establish that covenant with them which was promised when their sins should be
taken away. see Romans 11, 25, 26, & 27 and also Jeremiah 31. 31, 32, & 33,
This covenant has never been established with the house of Isreal nor with
th[e] house of Judah for it requires two parties to make a covenant and those
two parties must be agreed or no covenant can be made. Christ in the days of
his flesh proposed to make a covenant with them but they rejected him and his
proposals and in consequence thereof they were broken off and no covenant was
made with them at that time but their unbelief has not rendered the promise of
God of none effect; no, for there was another day limited in David which was
the day of his power and then his people Isreal, should be a willing people
and he would write his laws in their hearts and print them in their thoughts
their sins and their eniquities he would remember no more, Thus after this
chosen family had rejected Christ and his proposals the heralds of salvation
said to them. "..." and the gentiles
received the covenant and were grafted in from whence the chosen family were
broken off but the Gentiles have not continued in the goodness of God but have
departed from the faith that was once delivered to the saints and have broken
the everlasting covenant in which their fathers were established see Isaiah
24th 5th. and have become high minded and have not feared therefore but few of
them will be gathered with the chosen family Has not the pride highmindedness
and unbelief of the Gentiles provoked the holy one of Israel to withdraw his
holy spirit from them and send forth his Judgments to scourge them for their
wick edness; this is certianly the case, Christ said to his deciples Mark 16,
17 & 18 that these signs should follow them that believe; In my name shall
they cast out Devils they shall speap [speak] with new tongues they shall take
up serpants and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover, and also in connection
with this read 1 Corinthians 12 Chapt, By the foregoing testamonies or through
the glass of the foregoing testamonies we may look at the Christian world and
see the apostacy there has been from

the Apostolic platform, and who can look at this, and and not exclaim in the
language of Isaiah, ["..."

The plain fact is this, the power of God begins to fall upon the Nations, and
the light of the latter day glory begins to break forth through the dark
atmosphere of sectarian wickedness and their iniquity rools [rolls] up into
view and the Nations of the Gentiles are like the waves of the sea casting up
mire and dirt or all in commotion and they hastily are preparing to act the
part allotted them when the Lord rebukes the nations, when he shall rule them
with a rod of iron & break them in peaces like a potters vessel, The Lord has
declared to his servants some Eighteen months since that he was then
withdrawing his spirit from the earth, and we can see that such is the fact
for not only the churches are dwindling away, but there are no convers[i]ons,
or but very few, and this is not all, the governments of the earth are thrown
into confusion & division, and distruction to the eye of the spiritual
beholder seemes to be writen by the finger of an invisable hand in Large
capitals upon almost evry thing we behold——

And now what remains to be done under circumstan[c]es like these, I will
proce[e]d to tell you what the Lord requires of all people high and Low, rich
and poor, male and female, ministers & people professors of religeon, and
nonproffessors in order that they may enjoy the holy spirit of God to a
fulness, and escape the Judg ments of God which are almost ready to burst upon
the nations of the earth— Repent of all your sins and be baptized in water
for the remission of them, in the name of the father, and of the son, and of
the Holy Ghost, and receive the ordinance of the laying on of the hands of him
who is ordained and sealed unto this power, that ye may receive the holy
spirit of God, and this according to the holy scriptures, and of the Book of
Mormon; and

the only way that man can enter into the Celestial kingdom. These are the
requesitions of the new Covenant or first principles of of the Gospel of
Christ; then add to you[r] faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to
knowledge temperance, and to temperance patience, and to patience, brotherly
kindness and to brotherly kindness charity (or Love) and if these things be in
you and abound, they make you to be neither baran nor unfruitful in the
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ——

The Book of Mormon is a reccord of the forefathers of our western Tribes of
Indians, having been found through the ministration of an holy Angel
translated into our own Language by the gift and power of God, after having
been hid up in the earth for the last fourteen hundred years containing the
word of God, which was delivered unto them, By it we learn that our western
tribes of Indians are desendants from that Joseph that was sold into Egypt,
and that the Land of America is a promised land unto them, and unto it all the
tribes of Israel will come. with as many of the gentiles as shall comply with
the requesitions of the new co[v]en ant. But the tribe of Judah will return to
old Jerusalem, The City, of Zion, spoken of by David in the 102 Psalm will be
built upon the Land of America and the ransomed of the Lord shall return and
come to it with songs and ever lasting joy upon their heads, and then they
will be delivered from the overflowing scourge that shall pass through the
Land But Judah shall obtain deliverence at Jerusalem see Joel 2. 32. Isaiah
26, 20 & 21, Jer. 31, 12, Psalm 50. 5, Ezekiel 34, 11, 12 & 13, These are
testamonies that the good Shepherd will put forth his own sheep and Lead them
out from all nations where they have been scattered in a cloudy and dark day,
to Zion and to Jerusalem beside many more testamonies which might be
brought——

And now I am prepared to say by the authority of Jesus Christ, that not many
years shall pass away before the United States shall present such

a scene of bloodshed as has not a parallel in the hystory of our nation
pestalence hail famine and earthquake will sweep the wicked off this
generation from off the face of this Land to open and prepare the way for the
return of the lost tribes of Israel from the north country— The people of
the Lord, those who have complied with the requsitions of the new covenant
have already commenced gathering togethe[r] to Zion which is in the State of
Missouri. Therefore I decl are unto you the warning which the lord has
commanded me to declare unto this generation, rembring [remembering] that the
eyes of my maker are upon me and that to him I am accountabl for evry word I
say wishing nothing worse to my fellow men then their eternal salvation
therefore fear God, and give glory to him for the hour of his Judgment is
come, <Repent ye> Repent, ye and imbrace the everlasting Covenant and flee to
Zion before the over flowing scourge overtake you, For there are those now
living upon the earth whose eyes shall not be closed in death until they see
all these things which I have spoken fulfilled Rem[em]ber these things, call
upon the Lord while he is near and seek him while he may be found is the
exhortation of your unworthy servant
