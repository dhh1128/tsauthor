Letter to Hyrum
March 3 1831
Jessee p. 256

Brother Hyrum

We arrived here safe and are all well I have been engaged in regulating the Churches here as the disciples are numerous and the devil has made many attempts to overthrow them it has been a serious Job but the Lord is with us and we have overcome and have all things reular the work is breaking forth on the right hand and on the left and there is a great Call for Elders in this place we have received a letter from Oliver dated independence Jackson County Missouri January the 29th 1831 these are the words which he has written saying â€¦ thus reads most of the letter. 

My Dearly Beloved Brother Hyrum
I have had much concern about you but I always remember you in my prayers Calling upon god to keep you safe in spit of men or devils I think you had better come into this country immediately for the Lord has commanded us that we should call the elders of this church to gather unto this place as soon as possible.

March forth this morning after being called out of my bed in the night to go a small distance I went and had an awful struggle with satan but being armed with the power of God he was cast out and the woman is clothed in her right mind the Lord worth wonders in this land. 

I want to see you all may the grace of God be and abide with you all even so Amen
your Brother forever
