Sister Jennetta Richards:
Agreeably to your request, in the mist of all the bustle, and business of the day, and the care of all the churches both at home and abroad, I now embrace a moment to address a few words to you thinking peradventure it may be a consolation to you to know that you too are remembered by me as well as all the saints. My heart’s desire and prayer to God is all the day long for all the saints and in an especial and particular manner for those whom he hath chosen and anointed to bear the heaviest burthens in the heat of the day among which number is your husband received a man in whom I have the most implicit confidence and trust you say I have got him so I have in the which I rejoice, for he has done me great good and taken a great burden off my shoulders since his arrival in Nauvoo never did I have greater intimacy with any man than with him may the blessings of Elijah crown his head forever and ever. We are about to send him in a few days after his dear family he shall have our prayers fervently for his safe arrival to their embraces and may God speed his journey and return him quickly to our society, and I want you beloved Sister, to be a General in this matter, in helping him along, which I know you will he will be able to teach you many things which you never have heard you may have implicit confidence in the same. I have heard much about you by the twelve and in consequence of the great friendship that exists between your husband and me and the information they all have given me of your virtue and strong attachment to the truth of the work of God in the Last Days I have formed a very strong brotherly friendship and attachment for you in the bonds of the gospel, Although I never saw you I shall be exceedingly glad to see you face to face and be able to administer in the name of the Lord some of the words of life to your consolation and I hope that you may be kept steadfast in the faith even unto the end. I want you should give my love and tender regard to Brother Richards’ family and those who are friendly enough to me to inquire after me in that region of country, not having but little time to apportion to anyone and having stolen this opportunity I therefore subscribe myself in haste your most obedient brother in the fulness of the gospel
Joseph Smith

P.S. Brother Richards having been with me for a long time can give you any information which you need and will tell you all about me. I shall be very anxious for his return his a great prop to me in my labors.
