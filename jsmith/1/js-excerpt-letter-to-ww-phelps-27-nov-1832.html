yea thus saith the still small voice which whispereth through and pierceth all
things and often times it maketh my bones to quake while it maketh manifest
saying and it shall come to pass that I the Lord God will send one mighty and
strong holding the scepter of power in his hand clothed with light for a
covering whose mouth shall utter words Eternal words while his bowels shall be
a fountain of truth to set in order the house of God and to arrange by lot the
inheritance of the saints whose names are found and the names of their fathers
and of their children enrolled in the Book of the Law of God while that man
who was called of God and appointed that putteth forth his hand to steady the
ark of God shall fall by the shaft of death like as a tree that is smitten by
the vivid shaft of lightning and all they who are not found written in the
book of remembrance shall find none inheritance in that day but they shall be
cut asunder and their portion shall be appointed them among unbelievers where
is wailing and gnashing of teeth these things I say not of myself therefore as
the Lord speaketh he will also fulfill and they who are of the high priesthood
whose names are not found written in the book of the law or that are found to
have apostatized or to have been cut off out of the church as well as the
lesser priesthood or the members in that day shall not find an inheritance
among the saints of the most high therefore it shall be done unto them as unto
the children of the priest as you will find recorded in the second chapter and
sixty first and second verses of Ezra now Brother William if what I have said
is true how careful then had men ought to be what they do in the last days
lest they are cut short of their expectations and they that think they stand
should fall because they keep not the Lordâ€™s commandments whilst you who do
the will of the Lord and keep his commandments have need to rejoice with
unspeakable joy for such shall be exalted very high and shall be lifted up in
triumph above all the kingdoms of this world but I must drop this subject at
the beginning Oh Lord when will the time come when Brother William thy servant
and myself behold the day that we may stand together and gaze upon eternal
wisdom engraven upon the heavens while the majesty of our God holdeth up the
dark curtain until we may read the round of eternity to the fulness and
satisfaction of our immortal souls Oh Lord God deliver us in thy due time from
the little narrow prison almost as it were total darkness of paper pen and ink
