Letter to John Bernhisel, 16 Nov 1841
in the handwriting of John Taylor
Jessee, p. 533


Dear Sir
I received your kind present by the hand of Elder Woodruff and feel myself under many obligations for this mark of your esteem and friendship which to mis is more interesting as it unfolds and develops many things that are of great importance to this generation and corresponds with and supports the testimony of the Book of Mormon; I have read the volumes with the greatest interest and pleasure and must say that of all histories that have been written pertaining to the antiquities of this country it is the most correct luminous and comprehensive.
In regard to the land referred to by you I would simply state that I have lands both in and out of the City some of which I hold deeds for and others bonds for deeds when you come which I hope will be as soon as convenient you can make such a selection from among those as shall best meet with your needs and feelings. In grateful remembrance of your kindness I remain your affectionate brother in the bonds of the everlasting covenant
