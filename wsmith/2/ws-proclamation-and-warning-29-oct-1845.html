A PROCLAMATION.

And faithful Warning to all the Saints scattered around in Boston,

Philadelphia, New York, Salem, New Bedford, Jewell, Peterborough, Gilsom, St.

Louis, Nauvoo, and elsewhere in the United States;.Also to those residing in

the different parts of Europe and in the Islands of the seas.

To all such, your Father and Patriarch sends this Greeting -- He speaks to you

in the spirit of love and christian kindness, believing it a duty he owes to

his God, to do all he can to save from spiritual ruin the thousands of his

friends and fellow mortals, whom misrepresentation and false pretension may

contrive to lead astray from the pure and holy paths of righteousness as

pointed out by our church.

I take this course towards my brethren in all meekness of spirit, patience,

and forbearance, without aught of malice or revenge, that they may understand

the true reason of my silent course of conduct during the last summer, and the

cause of my present position.

I will state unequivocally at the outset, that it is my firm and sincere

conviction, that, since the murder of my two brothers, usurpation and anarchy,

and spiritual wickedness in high places, have crept into the church, with the

cognizance and acquiescence of those whose solemn duty it was to guardedly

watch against such estate of things. Under the reign of one whom I may call a

Pontius Pilate, under the reign I say of this B. Young, no greater tyranny

ever existed since the days of Nero. He has no other justification than

ignorance to cover the most cruel acts -- acts disgraceful to anyone bearing

the stamp of humanity; and this being has associated around him, men, bound by

oaths and covenants, who are reckless enough to commit almost any crime, or

fulfill any command that their self-crowned "..." might give them.

At the time of the death of my two brothers, I was laboring with all my

energies in the eastern cities, where I had been busily engaged for about

three years, under the direction and advice of my brother Joseph, when a

letter reached me from Willard Richards, who was acting as church clerk and

one of the Twelve, advising me not to return to the scene of the recent and

events in the west, as it might continue the excitement, and endanger not only

my own life, but the lives of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the Saints; such

also was the advice and counsel of many of my friends. This advice, together

with a sick family on my hands, influenced me to remain still a while longer

in the east. In the meantime, as all the Saints well know, I was engaged in

publishing a paper in New York entitled "..." got up by my own labors

and carried on with as much earnest zeal as I could possibly employ upon it.

All at once, early in the spring, whom should I encounter but XXTITLEANDNAME P.

Pratt, who had come on from the west, with specific authority from the quorum

of the Twelve, to take charge of all the printing, etc., without a single

provision with respect to my own personal rights, relative to any outlay I had

subjected myself to in getting up the paper, materials for printing, etc.

etc.; to take charge, also, of the entire presidency of the Eastern Churches;

while, at the same time, the right of the presidency was held by a joint

occupancy in the quorum of the Twelve. In consequence, however, of my wife's

health continuing very precarious, I concluded to leave that scene of action

and return to Nauvoo, leaving all in the hands of Parley P. Pratt, and S.

Brennan, which latter had been heretofore a friend. I must confess that the

whole of this proceeding appeared to me very much like a deep laid plan to get

the power of everything under their own control. Still I was extremely

reluctant to believe my brethren so ungrateful men with whom I had been

associated so long, being more over willing to obey council, I gave all up,

and trusted to their own honesty. -- On my return, however, my suspicions were

strengthened, for I found that, for some frivolous cause, the "..." had cut

off a brother of the name of G. J. Adams, who it was well known was a strong

and sincere friend of mine and also S. Brennan. Still I was anxious to get rid

of my suspicions, and I set about making the most minute enquiry into the

matter, but no substantial reason presented itself for the course taken.

Brennan was soon restored. It appeared to me, from these various

circumstances, strongly suspicious that these [assumers] of power intended

nothing more or less than to render me powerless. Still I struggled on, hoping

for the best, and that all things would come out right eventually, and I held

my peace, -- when on coming into council with the brethren, I was asked "..." evidently manifesting thereby a suspicion on

their part that it was not likely I could possibly be so, and that all had not

been right. Yet I replied that I was willing to abide the council of my

brethren and be satisfied for a season. They assumed a friendly feeling and

would frequently mention what they intended to do, and what is was in their

hearts to do, for me and the rest of the Smith family. Soon I spoke on the

stand, but with very oppressed feelings, which, however, I always endeavored

not to disclose, while news was arriving from the east, by letters and various

other ways, to the Council; and others, containing eulogiums on the boasted

righteousness of Parley P. Pratt, and condemning the acts of his predecessors

in the preaching and government of the church in that section of the country,

when it is well known by all the eastern Saints that when those men went on

all was peace and harmony, and that I had labored hard for three years to

build up the church, and for the last year to wrest it from the influence of

"..." And further it can be proved that B. Young and P. P. Pratt were

the first to preach and to practice the "..." doctrine, in the city

of Boston and other places, my descent from any such doctrine of course gave

annoyance, as did also my exclaiming against the too common practice among the

elders of using profane oaths. I earnestly appealed to them as to whether it

could possibly by consonant with the garb of a minister of the gospel, of

those who build Temples and Nauvoo Houses, thus to indulge in improper

swearing. That the Lord would not prosper their proceedings in such a spirit,

nor would they inherit a temporal or spiritual salvation. In this appeal I was

opposed by John E. Page. On another occasion I spoke in behalf of sister Emma,

and the claims of the Smith family, but this was generally laughed at. I

opposed also the whittling, whistling, and beastly anointing, practiced upon

strangers, and driving away from Nauvoo the doctors and lawyers, telling them,

which I did in a spirit of warning, that such courses must bring swift

destruction on the people. In return for these good intentions I was called a

dissenter, and the charge brought against me of trying to raise a division in

the church. My remarks had little or no effect, for again and again it was

repeated on the stand by Kimble, Young, Taylor, and others, that lawyers must

leave, for it was then a time of peace, and that if they did not they should

be offered as a sacrifice of smoking meat, as was practiced by the heathens in

ancient times, to appease the wrath of some evil spirit, and that as for the

doctors they were all a perfect nuisance. To all these elevated and charitable

thoughts and expressions, the congregation responded "..." All this was

entirely repugnant to my feelings and I could not avoid manifesting my

dissent; the consequence was, that I was informed I had better look out, or I

should be cut off from the church. It was a sacrifice indeed to be silent.

It was about this time that the Hodge affair took place, and I verily believe

that the very men who were engaged in that horrid murder were the most

efficient in doing all they possibly could to get the Hodges' hanged, and to

get Amos Hodge into the territory of Iowa, that he might share the fate of his

brothers, whether guilty or not. But to return to the matters of the church, I

published a short notice on the subject of the office of patriarch: very soon

it was scanned and criticised, and without even my knowledge or consent, the

office declared to be equal only to any common father over his family; which

was all a perfect burlesque on common sense, robbing me of my lawful rights in

the Smith family, rights by lineage, etc. The phrase "..."

become a common byword, a matter of sport on the stand, and in private council

a laugh. Mother Smith's mind being greatly wrought upon by these troubles, was

carried away in a vision, and on her relation of what she had seen. Brigham

Young had the refinement of feeling and consideration to ridicule on the stand

the whole matter and marveled that the church could entertain for a moment the

crazy manifestations of an old woman. Such remarks, be it borne in mind,

proceeded from one who pretends to hold the key of telling where the royal

blood is, and claims a standing at the head of a church raised up by a

prophet, of whom mother Smith was the parent, and which mother had passed

through whole seas of affliction. A copy of this vision will soon appear, and

then we shall see and understand the value of the priesthood of that

individual who can thus talk of mother Smith, as also of the propriety of a

certain John Smith and others who find it to their interest to ridicule rather

than reflect. But to return from this digression. I took it upon me to counsel

the police of the city, advise them to be more merciful, and not hasten men

into Iowa to be hanged, but to give them a chance with others whom I believe

to be equally guilty. I received for answer to my advice and counsel, from one

of the police, that he did not care a d__n for anything I had to say; that he

had received his instructions, and should carry them out. Although some words

passed on the occasion, I believe this particular member of the police was

innocent of any intentional harm. The result again of this was, that I was

cautioned to look out for my life.

A horrid circumstance took place on the following evening, which I must

relate. -- Arvine [sic] Hodge was crossing a field-path to his lodgings, when

he was waylaid and killed, being cut, beat, and mangled in a most shocking

manner, within twenty rods of Brigham Young's house, which at the time was

surrounded by his own personal police guard, who, as some of them

acknowledged, stood within fifty yards of where the murder was committed, and

distinctly heard the murderous blows, and the cries of the victim. Sister

Young, also, said that she heard them more than once. Young was not at home

when the deed was done, but, it is said that in honor to him the murdered man

with cries for help, ran some twenty rods, and fell in the road before the

house and expired.

It is said that although he had his senses til the last, he would say no more

about his murderer than that he was a friend; and called on Young to lay hands

upon him. This story was told by Young's police, who, be it remembered, stood

within fifty yards of where this awful murder was perpetrated, who heard the

blows given, and also the cries for help, but who, at the same time, saw no

man or men, who could have performed the awful deed.

It will be recollected that, on the examination, it was ascertained that

Arvine Hodge had received four fatal stabs in the side, each blow sundering a

rib, and sufficient to cause instant death, besides the appearance of cruel

bruises made by heavy clubs upon the head. It is true no doubt that he

struggled hard for life, but is it probable, I would ask, that with such fatal

wounds from the knife, and heavy blows from the assassin's clubs, that he

could have retained physical strength enough to run for aid, or mental power

enough to ask for the laying on of hands? And especially for one whom he had

every reason to believe to be his most inveterate enemy? It was at this

juncture of these sad proceedings, that the information reached my ears,

advising me to keep a good guard about my house, or I might very probably

share the fate of Arvine Hodge. In consequence of such information, I summoned

my kind friends who watched over my safety for two or three weeks; The

necessity of my doing this prompted me to write a letter to B. Young, stating

to him that I did not feel my safe in the hands of his police. The answer

returned to me was from John Taylor, to the effect that I should meet the

council the same day at six o'clock in the evening. Accordingly at the hour

specified, I repaired to the place of meeting, not expecting, however, to find

any one present save the "..." or the Bishops. But on entering the room on

the third story of the Masonic Hall, what was my surprize to find some fifty

or sixty policemen all armed with their Bowie knives, pistols, and hickory

clubs. How much more too, was my surprize, when after my entrance I found the

door guarded, and the man whom I had supposed a particular friend of mine,

chuckling with sparkling eyes to think he had me in his power.

I was called upon by Brigham Young to make known my grievances. I answered the

call, and in fervent tones both long and loud, spoke of my grievances and of

my two brothers' deaths, and of the almost entire desolation of the remnant of

my father's family; -- that I had returned from a long mission, and wished to

settle in the land of my ancestors, and that where the bodies of my brother's

lay, I wished to live in peace, and claim the protection due to me. I told

them that I considered my right to teach the church altogether unimpeachable;

as was also my right to counsel the police, and to assist in controlling the

public sentiment. Further, that if the brethren did not want me or my

councils, to announce such a sentiment and I would leave them. Let, said I,

the Twelve say so -- Let the Bishops say so -- Let the police say so, and I am

gone! But mark it, said I, where I go, there also the Smith family go, and

with them also goes the Priesthood.

After I had spoken for nearly an hour to the foregoing purpose, Brigham Young

arose, and although when he came into the room he had given me his hand, with

a smiling countenance, launched forth in the following strain, with boisterous

boldness:

"..." and strange to say all the police

and the bishops, and the "..." who were present, said thereunto, "..."

The conclusion I drew from all this was, that it was an intentional hint to me

that I had better leave. Furthermore he stated that Joseph Smith had revealed

to him a mystery concerning the Royal Blood, that none of the rest of his

brethren knew anything about; that little Joseph his eldest son was not the

prophet of the church, nor ever would be, and that if he were to say so, it

would be aiming a dagger at his life's blood. What reflection could possibly

suggest itself to me, after such a statement? What else then that he was an

ambitious and an ungrateful tyrant? It was now almost dark when I arose and

made a few corrections -- the brow-storm grew more palpable, not a smile, not

a pleasant look greeted me, as I looked around on my old associates. Among

those in the house I observed fifty or sixty of my well known brethren, but

not one smile, amen, or consoling word reached me. I tempered my remarks as

well and as charitably as I could: which forbearance was answered with remarks

from Young to the effect that the police were good men, and obedient to the

council.

Various circumstances induced me to believe myself hedged in, and I looked at

the door, and at the window, but with a very faint hope of escape; it was

death to jump from the window, and the armed police prevented all escape from

the door, so I sunk back and cried in the very agony of spirit, "..." At this juncture Brigham Young said, "..." To this I agreed and obtained a vote for my protection. It was now quite

dark, and wagons and carriages were all in readiness, so that with the

greatest ease I could have been sent on a long mission, to preach the Gospel.

It was at this time that I determined to leave to city as soon as possible,

and to preserve peace, and avoid any outbreak of feeling, I cautiously kept my

own counsel. Rumors however were again spread about by malcontent rivals, that

the saints had better be cautiously on their guard; with respect to me, for

that I intended neither more nor less than to bring about a division in the

Church. It was to allay the feeling that such reports might excite that I

preached the notorious, so called, "..." sermon, a discourse so

modified however as to be perfectly consonant with my own feelings, and

entirely unobjectionable to the pure principles of morality and religion. I

had another object in this which was to expose to the light the principles of

men who delighted to practice in private that which in public they strenuously

deprecated. The talk however still continued 'look out,' 'look out,' and

efforts were still made to render my position as disagreeable and unhappy as

possible. I still continued on in the consciousness of the purity of my

motives, and did not reveal my wounded feelings even to my mother, though all

the time the malevolence of my rivals was aiming shafts at me, by spreading

tales even so far back as my very boyhood, in connection with my brother

Joseph, things which had been passed into oblivion long, long ago. --

Furthermore, so strong was the spirit of prejudice that brethren and sisters

were even advised to go to others instead of to me to obtain their spiritual

blessings.

A libelous article was published by John Taylor, on my Patriarchal office,

which reached my mother's ears and occasioned her much mental trouble, and

loss of rest. To such an extent was her mind affected that she sent to find

me, and when I entered her room, she exclaimed, "..." A singular coincidence with the very situation in

which I had been placed, but which had been kept entirely secret from her.

From this time the Saints may understand that the proceedings of those who had

assumed the authority were kept entirely hidden from me. The disposition of

the Temple funds, counseling with regard to the affairs of the church, I have

had nothing to do with. Other men have been sought out to act in my place,

without the thought of waiting for "..." All these things

combined together served to convince me that a conspiracy had been entered

into, to disrobe me of my power, and I learned that all the quorums of the

church had agreed to sustain Brigham Young by their votes and influence, as

the perpetual head of the church, and sole control of its matters. That the

church funds have been misapplied, I have no hesitation in asserting, for of

necessity I have been made acquainted with the fact, that several houses have

been filled up with women who have been secretly married to Brigham Young, H.

C. Kimble, and Willard Richards -- women with little children in their arms,

who had no means of support except from the tithing funds.

And now brethren, I leave it to you to say what shall be done? My counsel is

that you at once stop tithing; further my sincere and earnest advice is that

the brethren locate themselves in all large branches of the church throughout

the United States, remembering that America is the land of Zion, the land

promised to the seed of Joseph. Furthermore let the brethren content

themselves by building up plain and comfortable meeting houses for the worship

of the Lord, until we can [inhabit] the temples we have built, and let all

honest saints remain at their homes, and not be led astray by false hopes and

promises, either to California or elsewhere. I am told that the plans of

getting the tabernacle canvas was all concocted in secret, and with the

ultimate intention of appropriating the same for the construction of tents to

be used in traveling. What think you now my brethren of "..."

None so holy as these men, yet nothing too knavish or underhanded for them to

perform.

In noticing the claims of Brigham Young to superior power and authority, I

would here observe that I heard my brother Joseph declare before his death,

that Brigham Young was a man, whose passions, if unrestrained, were calculated

to make him the most licentious man in the world, and should the time ever

come, said he, that this man should lead the church, he would certainly lead

it to destruction. What, my brethren, I would ask you, are the claims of

Brigham Young to the keys of the church, above the rest of the Twelve? They

are keys which Joseph never conferred on Brigham Young, nor was power ever

given to him to lead the church in his place as his successor. The church is

hereby warned against any such pretensions, as little Joseph, the son of

Joseph Smith is the lawful heir to the officer, being the oldest son of the

deceased prophet. I was present with Joseph at the last council that was held

previous to the Twelve and others going on their electioneering campaign to

the east and various other parts of the United States; it was at this time

that I receive my initiation into the highest priesthood lodge, was washed and

anointed, and clad with the sacerdotal robe of pure white, and ordained to be

priest and king, and invested with all the power that any man on earth ever

did possess; power entitling me to preach the gospel, to bind up the kingdom

of God on earth, among all nations, and people of every tongue. In consequence

of these endowments and ordination received from under the hands of Joseph, I

hold as much power and as many keys to seal and bind on earth, as can possibly

belong to Brigham Young; this power was conferred equally on all the Twelve,

and not therefore bestowed on one. The brethren must understand, too, that

Brigham Young holds the presidency over the eleven men by age merely, and not

by any legitimate authority, neither has he any superior keys; and the saints

will bear in mind that a presidency over twelve men, admitted out of courtesy

to age, does not make a man president, prophet, seer revelator, and perpetual

head of the church, over a whole dynasty of people, to the exclusion of the

lawful heir, the heir by blood and by lineage. Brethren, let my true position

be known to you; reflect and you will clearly see that Brigham Young is not

lawfully or legally the prophet or head of the church, and that to claim such

a right is usurpation and an act of tyranny; it is robbing the innocent -- the

widow and the fatherless. Further, the saints are informed that the old

pioneers, fathers and founders of this church of Christ in this last

dispensation, namely the Smith family, must and will stand at the head, as

leaders of this dispensation in time and in eternity. According to our book of

covenants, the priesthood must be handed down from father to son.

Again, the position of the "..." is defined in the same book, as merely a

"..." to open and make known the kingdom abroad, and not as

a local presidency. Since the death of Joseph and Hiram, the church has never

been organized, although the materials have been all on hand. Its present

condition is that of a headless body. It cannot be perfect until there are

three presidents. It is just as needful that the church have all its members,

with a head to govern it, now as in the days of Joseph, or many years ago.

Temples therefore reared up, and endowments given, by usurpers, or by a

headless body, can be no other than imperfect. And is not probable, I would

ask, that Temples, Nauvoo Houses and other buildings, however richly wrought

and gorgeously and sumptuously furnished, such palaces may be reared up in

wickedness, by means of cheating and defrauding the poor, by keeping up secret

combinations for robbing and plundering the Gentiles -- a Gadiantan Band --

altogether contrary to the XXBOOKOFMORMON, how, I would ask, can it be

expected that the Almighty will bless or suffer to prosper. How, I would ask,

can it be expected that Divine endowments can be given in such houses, or that

God will ever bless such a priesthood or such a people. It is this secret

combination that has concocted the California expedition, and that are the

present ruling authorities of Nauvoo, and the assumed directors of the church,

to whom thousands are looking for their endowments. Mark me, many and honest

saint will bitterly rue they ever followed the advice of such counselors, and

the more especially should they wander with such men into the wilds of the

forest, and there become, as they assuredly would, slaves, yea even more, a

prey to the beastly passions of tyrants, deprived altogether of the sweets of

liberty and the freedom of speech. I heard Brigham Young say not long since,

and the remark made my blood run cold, that, the man that did not comply with

the measures established by them in that land his head should come off, or at

all events none should return to tell their tales. These men will tell you

stories of peace and plenty, but I warn you to believe them not; they will

tell you of a land of liberty, and call it the "..." they will talk of raising a standard of freedom for the

oppressed, and tell you, you will enjoy liberty, sweet liberty; they will tell

you all these things and much more, till once they get you within their grasp.

Then, my brethren and sisters you will be robbed by them of all that is

virtuous and good; also of your property, and if need be, even of your lives.

Less than five or ten years will reveal the sad tale of the utter ruin of all

that engaged in this venturesome and hazardous expedition. No matter my

brethren, what may be represented to you as boastful perfections and imaginary

beauties and qualities, of the self-styled "..." or "..." and their building temples in the moon, or in the dark and deep

wilderness, thousands of miles away from all the inhabitants or civilized

life. All such fanciful notions must necessarily fade away like the airy

visions of heathen worshippers, to sink and rise no more; yes, like the

crumbled ruins of decayed and burnt up cities -- or like the "..." hid

up in the corner stones, or like the deposited parchments of ancient days,

declaratory of the greatness of certain self righteous men, seen in Heavenly

visions, or more properly in the mental wanderings of filthy daylight

dreamers, with their one hundred and one temples; all such things must come as

far short of the truth of an eternal reality, as will the power of the evil

one in dispossessing the righteousness of God, and possessing the kingdom for

ever. Let the Elders understand this, and proclaim against it, in the fear of

God, and thus save the souls of men from ruin. Follow no such spirits, my

brethren but follow such men as Hyram and Joseph, Peter and Jesus, and all

such spirits as do justice, in that respect the rights of all men, and

especially of the widow and the fatherless.

It is astonishing indeed to see the religious chicanery and hypocrisy of those

men. In the first place Adams comes on east, bearing letters from Willard

Richards and the Council of Nauvoo, announcing the deaths of Hiram and Joseph

Smith, to the scattering "..." with advice to me not to return at present

to Nauvoo, for fear of increasing the excitement; thus by my absence enabling

them to use all efforts, to get the Church bound up to Brigham Young, as its

president; the rest of the Twelve resigning all their power into his hands,

and thereby rendering themselves powerless.

Thus they thought to get a dig at me, having the bishops ready to say "..."

with a police bound by covenants and oaths to protect the said Brigham Young,

as the president and head of the church, and to carry out all his measures.

While this Brigham Young was pampering the church with the idea that although

little Joseph was the rightful heir to the priesthood, and office of his

father as prophet, seer, and revelator, that it was not prudent to mention

this for fear of the little child's life. This was the talk to me, and was one

reason why I made the declaration of my satisfaction, still being anxious to

believe these men honest. At another time I spoke of the church being without

a head, three Presidents, etc., etc., but such observations were treated with

lightness and as being of no consideration. And although the matter was

dropped for a time, I still heard and saw, and every day's proceeding

convinced me, that something was radically wrong.

The impression that B. Young was the successor and had even more power than

Joseph, that things prospered better, etc., etc., was spread about in all

directions. -- And to complete this man's reign of power, there was adopted,

as I have before alluded to, the system of spiritual wifery, which was entered

into secretly: and directions given to John Taylor and others to proclaim on

the stand that all saints should call on Brigham Young for counsel

notwithstanding I was by right a counselor of the church. It was, my brethren,

in this way, that the cords were drawn tighter and closer. Men's wives and

daughters were secretly married at night-time to this Young, H. C. Kimball,

William Richards, and others, and, in the dark night, were attending the

secret lodges, until most of the "..." were thus sealed and bound under

a cloak of adopting children into their kingdoms.

All these measures were profoundly secret, and the actors were bound to

protect the noble fathers and lords. In addition to this every exertion was

made to ordain every one in the shape of man, and induce them to join the

"..." and thus become adopted "..." As soon as they had been

induced to take the step, they soon found a reason for being no longer

Smithites. Still while all these iniquitous proceedings were going on, it was

the common practice for these wicked plotters to boldly and blasphemously

proclaim before people, in the presence, too of hundreds that have been

"..." to them, that such a doctrine was false, and he that practiced it

was a scoundrel and the woman that admitted it no other than a harlot.

I declare to you, my brethren, that I heard John Taylor proclaim this on one

occasion, so vociferously as almost to turn him black in the face, while in a

day or two afterwards he was seen sneaking through a garden, to get into a

house by the back way to visit his "..."

These have been the proceedings at Nauvoo for the last five months, these have

been the practices in contradistinction to professions. The very doctrines

they would teach and practice in secret, they would make use of to ruin,

before the public, those who would not become their servants and their slaves.

And now, my brethren and sisters, I again call on you, and especially on

those, if there be any, who still remember the claims of little Joseph, and

who have still respect for the memory of the martyrs Joseph and Hyrum, who can

still sigh when they think of their deaths. I call upon you, I say, to come

out of this Brigham Young's power, and to denounce his claims and pretensions,

for be assured, they are not of God. Discard, my friends, all such hypocrisy

and secret works, all such deeds of darkness. For Gadiantan Bands, secret

combinations to murder, and plunder the gentiles, and trespass upon other

men's rights, by discarding the marriage contract, can do nothing else than

establish licentiousness, and corrupt the mortals of the rising generation.

From all such abominations I proclaim myself free and independent, and I

implore my friends again and again, especially those of the Smith family, to

fly from this sink of iniquity and abomination, and assist in reorganizing the

church of God on the old and pure gospel of Mormonism, and in accordance with

the XXBOOKOFMORMON, the Bible, and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. Bear in

mind my friends that all this I speak from the deepest feelings of my heart,

as the brother of the murdered martyrs, and the representative of the

remaining remnants of the Smith family. It is now more than eighteen years

that I have borne the storms of a persecuting world, in the firm and confident

belief of the Mormon religion, as taught and practised by my brothers Joseph

and Hyrum, and by my father, ever since the hiding of the golden plates from

which the XXBOOKOFMORMON was translated. And to be told now that I am to have

no control over the church of Christ, but that it is to be controlled and

counseled by others, is not only palpable and gross in justice, but wicked in

the sight of the Lord. It is my intention to appoint, in due time, a

conference for the consideration of these and all other matters, of which due

notice will be given to all.

I ought to have mentioned in a former place, that on one occasion, I heard

Brigham Young say, on the stand, that he was glad Alvine Hodge was killed, and

that he considered those who would follow the assassins even to the

Mississippi river, were neither more nor less than fools, and that he hoped

all such men would "..." That in the territory of

Iowa, murderers had been hanged and he knew it, though he did not think proper

to tell his hearers how, he knew it. And he said further that it was far

better for Alvine [sic] Hodge to die, than to live any longer in sin, for that

he might now possibly be redeemed in the eternal world. That his murderers had

done even a deed of charity for that such a man deserved to die. This as I

before observed was stated on the public stand, and I leave the public to

estimate the spirit in which they were made, and to draw their own conclusions

as to whose counsel, and by what hands, the Hodges met their death, and their

brother Alvine murdered in the streets of Nauvoo -- the victim dying in this

noble lord's door-yard.

Another matter may not be omitted, namely: that Brigham Young, John Taylor,

and Willard Richards with the appointed bishops have assumed the publishing of

the Church Documents, the Book of Covenants, and also Joseph's private

history, as their own property entirely regardless of the rights of the Smith

family as therewith connected.

Again, in addition to all this assumption of power they have combined

themselves into secret lodges, councils, etc., where they concoct all their

plans unknown to the common people of the church, out of this have arisen the

whitling and whistling societies for disposing of strangers, and the beastly

annointing of all who oppose their plans. With this council I am told, the

Indians hold a correspondence, and men are frequently rent to colleague with

them. Some three or four are now on a visit to the western tribes. Of late,

one of their number of the name of Dunham, died among the Indians; he went by

the name of "..." and was known by that cognomen among many of the

Mormons. On the company to which he belonged returning to Nauvoo, a portion of

them were sent to the east, for the purpose of raising men for a general

campaign among the Indians, to be entitled 'secret braves.' The names of these

men can easily be had. The circumstances under which I left Nauvoo are such,

that I feel it a duty thus to lay them before my friends and brethren. I did

not leave that place too soon, for the very day of my departure it was

whispered to me that a secret plot was already concocted for taking away my

life.

The saints then, will see from the foregoing, that although it was my

privilege to act as counselor to the church, and as patriarch over the whole

church, in the place of my brother Hyrum, a fact, with regard to right, which

had been over and over again admitted, as the brethren must all well remember.

But now how have things changed? All the acts of those who have usurped the

power have been most illiberal and uncharitable towards me, and the most

flagrant outrage of rights as well as the breaking of sacred covenants have

plainly shown their treachery and deceit.

All these things combine with their secret combinations, I conceive to be

ample cause to induce me to disfellowship such men, and to denounce all their

measures. Deprived of the right of acting as counselor of the saints during

the last summer, I have been obliged to sit down in silence, and permit

iniquity; anarchy and oppression to go on unrestrained. I feel as though I

would even now shrink from the task of exposing these matters, were it not for

the promptings of duty, and a hope that good may ultimately result -- I leave

the event with God While I write to you, my brethren, the feeling that I have

been wronged and abused, is struggling for the mastery. With full confidence

however, I leave it to my friends, and the friends of justice to say, whether

or not, after all the labors of my father's family, of my brother Joseph in

particular, to build up the church of Christ, after all the sacrifices made by

them, and the privations and persecutions endured by them, I leave it, I say,

to all feeling and honest hearts, to pronounce whether or not men who never

saw or knew Joseph Smith, until all such sacrifices have been made; should

assume the privilege of casting off the Smith family, and depriving his lineal

successors of the right to teach and direct the church and correct its evils.

Such a course of proceeding, and by a band of men, too, whose deeds would make

"..." and the honest in heart to quake, were they fully

exposed to the light. -- Even while I pen these remarks to you I fancy I see

the care worn visage of my poor old mother, broken down, as she is and almost

worn out with the accumulated troubles of years. I see too, in fancy, three

sisters, with their husbands, struggling hard in the midst of poverty;

relatives, my friends, who have endured the contumely of the world, and who

have had to brave the storm of persecution from the first, in peril, in

wretchedness, and in want. To think, I say, of all they have gone through, and

that now they should be deprived of all honor and station in the church, have

no word of controlment in the affairs of the church, and that those who did

seem to have a valor, should be now shut out, cannot possible appear to the

brethren as anything else than acts of ingratitude and illiberality. My poor

old mother has witnessed (it was not enough) the burial of him who was the

partner of her life, of my poor father, the good old patriarch, but his

departure to the grave has no effect on the feelings of these usurpers of

power, nor has either the melancholy martyrdom of her two sons, my brothers. I

feel, brethren, as though I were alone among thousands, and my griefs have

remained hidden within my own breast, lest they should disturb the peace of a

parent almost within her grave. I have borne these oppressions and wrongs

until I feel as though they had eaten into my heart like a devouring worm, and

wasted my life away for lack of peace, of rest, and of hope. Night and day

prayed I that the bitter cup might pass, but the thought will obtrude itself,

of all that has been done, and ungratefully repaid, to my mother, my brethren,

and my sisters. I cannot but think of the thousands they have fed and clothed,

and of the awful storms of persecution they have waded through, and of the

threatenings of death they have boldly faced, in order to build up the church,

that now should be imparting spiritual life to millions of souls. I cannot but

solemnly think, too, that she who was the mother of the prophet should now, in

these evil times, be ridiculed on the public stand. And by the very men over

whom she has acted as a mother in the church. These accumulations of sorrow

have been to me alone beyond endurance, and my brethren, must pardon any

evidence of weakness. Pardon, however, need not be hatred for telling simple

and plain truths. "..." is an old and just motto, "..." and respecting it there cannot need excuse. I anticipate

nothing more or less than the hatred of these men to whom I have referred in

the foregoing remarks, the vials of their wrath will undoubtedly be poured out

on my head, and the bitterest anathemas altered against me, to injure and

misrepresent my character and motives. But these things will not be done by

any fair and honorable means; drowning men, as saith the proverb, always

snatch at straws, and this will be in regard to these matters. By vile means

will they seek to accomplish their vile purposes, or as the poets say: "..." and that "..." "..." Treachery and deceit have been the game played by these men

until they have congregated around them a large body of people to Nauvoo,

bound by covenants, promises, and secret oaths, to such an extent as to

prevent them from breaking off or leaving these men. It is this by treachery

and deceit, that their purposes have to be maintained Notwithstanding all

these things, however, let the storm be ever so rough, I am fully prepared for

the worst. By the help of God, I shall outride the tempest. Their mercy or

their pity I solicit not; I look upon them as a disorganized body, without

power to save, curse, or damn. Without power, also, to "..." Their acts,

like wicked spirits, (for as such I regard them) will do only to be numbered

with such like spirits in hell; and their deeds of cruelty and acts of

injustice will assuredly sink them deeper and deeper in impenetrable darkness

forever, unless they repent and restore all that they have taken away from the

innocent. Not even a prayer of the murdered victims they have so much gloried

in shall be theirs, and the candlestick shall be removed. There is, my

brethren, not the slightest cause whatever why the church should have so long

remained unorganized, and to be, as it now is, a mere headless body; the

causes, however, from the foregoing statement, must now be plainly evident; it

is usurpation, tyranny, and wickedness of the blackest dye, that have

occasioned it all. Let the brethren read the prophets, and there they will

plainly see that Samuel, the prophet, was ordained while he was yet only a

child, as was also the prophet Noah. For the truth of these remarks, I refer

you to our book of covenants, on lineage, ordinations, etc., etc. Even

children were named, and their work and destiny appointed them, by the angel

of God, while they were still unborn. It appears evident to me that when,

hereafter, souls wake upon heaven, or the eternal world, it will be found that

God did not lie, when he declared that in the posterity of Joseph all the

nations of the earth should be blessed. And if Joseph does not frown upon

those who profess that they are carrying out his measures, while at the same

time they are robbing his son of his lawful inheritance, then I have but a

poor idea of human justice, or of the moral virtues of the angels in heaven.

To digress once more, be it remembered that John Taylor fancied he had done a

brave thing when he published his false notions and misstatements with regard

to my patriarchal office, at a time when he knew I had not the power of

defense, in consequence of the rich and liberally installed virtues of the

Nauvoo police. Poor simple man! "..."

So he did, but why? Because he was of the royal blood no doubt. But why, XXTITLEANDNAME, had you not read that Christ was of a branch of the house of Israel of

which branch nothing was said concerning the priesthood? And again, it was not

expected that Christ's priesthood should come through the lineage of his

mother, but from God. Hence the saints will notice the difference. Joseph

Smith inherited his priesthood by lineage, he being a descendant of Joseph,

who was sold into Egypt, and the same priesthood is continued from father to

son -- as was, also, my patriarchal office inherited from my father and

brother Hyrum.

And now, brethren, permit me to say, that so long as the sun, moon, and stars

perform their successive revolutions, so long both on earth and hereafter,

shall I have faith in the doctrine of legal descent, lineage & blood. And the

'Twelve' might as well claim to be my father and mother, as to claim to be the

authors of my patriarchal priesthood, an office for which I return no thanks

to any one on earth, but only to my Father in Heaven. It is an office to which

I shall lay claim to the day of my death. It is upon such principles that I

take my ground, and hold myself in readiness to meet any fate at the bar of

God. The Twelve did not ordain me one of their number, nor decree my lineage

in the Smith family, and I shall never suffer myself to be controlled by

Brigham Young or any of his coadjutors. It was from a love of peace, my

brethren and sisters, and from no other motive, that I have delayed the

publication of these remarks. I determined to await till order and quietness

were restored to Nauvoo, being unwilling to inflame a wicked and unhallowed

mob, to distress the Innocent and unoffending. I well know that there are

hundreds of honest Saints, of good and virtuous, and noble spirits, in the

city of Nauvoo, respecting whom I hope and pray that they will canvass these

things in their minds and snap asunder their present yoke of oppression, and

strive to secure to all a just recompense of what is due to them.

God knows I wish to do right and to see the church prosper; to this end I have

labored for years. My only desire now is that my friends be calm and devote

their minds to the cultivation of the spirit of kindness; to do good to all,

to deal justly, and to love mercy. The doctrine that the gentiles are a prey

to devouring fire, and under the wrath of God, shews nothings but a malignant

spirit, the very reverse of the feeling of the Holy Being that died for us on

the cross. Let the saints content themselves in different bodies in the

different states, and build churches and school houses, for the edification

and education of themselves and children, and thus become a delightful people,

clad with Gospel grace.

And now may the God of peace and abundant mercy abide with all the faithful.

May He be present with all the honest in heart, and may He deliver the

innocent from all fear, and prompt the pure-minded saint, to come out, and

assist in building up the kingdom as it was at the beginning. That Zion may

put on her beautiful garments, and see no more the wasting and destruction of

her borders. Let the feeling of the heart be to bury every weapon of death,

and learn war no more. Ever and anon, my friends and brethren, you will hear

from me again. In the mean time permit me to assure you that I am in all

sincerity of heart and singleness of purpose your affectionate and devoted

brother. Also your earnest fellow-laborer in the gospel.

WILLIAM SMITH,

One of the "..." and Patriarch of XXCHURCHFULL.
