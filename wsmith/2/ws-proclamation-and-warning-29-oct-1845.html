<p>
A PROCLAMATION.
</p>

<p>
And faithful Warning to all the Saints scattered around in Boston,
</p>

<p>
Philadelphia, New York, Salem, New Bedford, Jewell, Peterborough, Gilsom, St.
</p>

<p>
Louis, Nauvoo, and elsewhere in the United States;.Also to those residing in
</p>

<p>
the different parts of Europe and in the Islands of the seas.
</p>

<p>
To all such, your Father and Patriarch sends this Greeting -- He speaks to you
</p>

<p>
in the spirit of love and christian kindness, believing it a duty he owes to
</p>

<p>
his God, to do all he can to save from spiritual ruin the thousands of his
</p>

<p>
friends and fellow mortals, whom misrepresentation and false pretension may
</p>

<p>
contrive to lead astray from the pure and holy paths of righteousness as
</p>

<p>
pointed out by our church.
</p>

<p>
I take this course towards my brethren in all meekness of spirit, patience,
</p>

<p>
and forbearance, without aught of malice or revenge, that they may understand
</p>

<p>
the true reason of my silent course of conduct during the last summer, and the
</p>

<p>
cause of my present position.
</p>

<p>
I will state unequivocally at the outset, that it is my firm and sincere
</p>

<p>
conviction, that, since the murder of my two brothers, usurpation and anarchy,
</p>

<p>
and spiritual wickedness in high places, have crept into the church, with the
</p>

<p>
cognizance and acquiescence of those whose solemn duty it was to guardedly
</p>

<p>
watch against such estate of things. Under the reign of one whom I may call a
</p>

<p>
Pontius Pilate, under the reign I say of this B. Young, no greater tyranny
</p>

<p>
ever existed since the days of Nero. He has no other justification than
</p>

<p>
ignorance to cover the most cruel acts -- acts disgraceful to anyone bearing
</p>

<p>
the stamp of humanity; and this being has associated around him, men, bound by
</p>

<p>
oaths and covenants, who are reckless enough to commit almost any crime, or
</p>

<p>
fulfill any command that their self-crowned "..." might give them.
</p>

<p>
At the time of the death of my two brothers, I was laboring with all my
</p>

<p>
energies in the eastern cities, where I had been busily engaged for about
</p>

<p>
three years, under the direction and advice of my brother Joseph, when a
</p>

<p>
letter reached me from Willard Richards, who was acting as church clerk and
</p>

<p>
one of the Twelve, advising me not to return to the scene of the recent and
</p>

<p>
events in the west, as it might continue the excitement, and endanger not only
</p>

<p>
my own life, but the lives of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the Saints; such
</p>

<p>
also was the advice and counsel of many of my friends. This advice, together
</p>

<p>
with a sick family on my hands, influenced me to remain still a while longer
</p>

<p>
in the east. In the meantime, as all the Saints well know, I was engaged in
</p>

<p>
publishing a paper in New York entitled "..." got up by my own labors
</p>

<p>
and carried on with as much earnest zeal as I could possibly employ upon it.
</p>

<p>
All at once, early in the spring, whom should I encounter but XXTITLEANDNAME
P.
</p>

<p>
Pratt, who had come on from the west, with specific authority from the quorum
</p>

<p>
of the Twelve, to take charge of all the printing, etc., without a single
</p>

<p>
provision with respect to my own personal rights, relative to any outlay I had
</p>

<p>
subjected myself to in getting up the paper, materials for printing, etc.
</p>

<p>
etc.; to take charge, also, of the entire presidency of the Eastern Churches;
</p>

<p>
while, at the same time, the right of the presidency was held by a joint
</p>

<p>
occupancy in the quorum of the Twelve. In consequence, however, of my wife's
</p>

<p>
health continuing very precarious, I concluded to leave that scene of action
</p>

<p>
and return to Nauvoo, leaving all in the hands of Parley P. Pratt, and S.
</p>

<p>
Brennan, which latter had been heretofore a friend. I must confess that the
</p>

<p>
whole of this proceeding appeared to me very much like a deep laid plan to get
</p>

<p>
the power of everything under their own control. Still I was extremely
</p>

<p>
reluctant to believe my brethren so ungrateful men with whom I had been
</p>

<p>
associated so long, being more over willing to obey council, I gave all up,
</p>

<p>
and trusted to their own honesty. -- On my return, however, my suspicions were
</p>

<p>
strengthened, for I found that, for some frivolous cause, the "..." had cut
</p>

<p>
off a brother of the name of G. J. Adams, who it was well known was a strong
</p>

<p>
and sincere friend of mine and also S. Brennan. Still I was anxious to get rid
</p>

<p>
of my suspicions, and I set about making the most minute enquiry into the
</p>

<p>
matter, but no substantial reason presented itself for the course taken.
</p>

<p>
Brennan was soon restored. It appeared to me, from these various
</p>

<p>
circumstances, strongly suspicious that these [assumers] of power intended
</p>

<p>
nothing more or less than to render me powerless. Still I struggled on, hoping
</p>

<p>
for the best, and that all things would come out right eventually, and I held
</p>

<p>
my peace, -- when on coming into council with the brethren, I was asked "..."
evidently manifesting thereby a suspicion on
</p>

<p>
their part that it was not likely I could possibly be so, and that all had not
</p>

<p>
been right. Yet I replied that I was willing to abide the council of my
</p>

<p>
brethren and be satisfied for a season. They assumed a friendly feeling and
</p>

<p>
would frequently mention what they intended to do, and what is was in their
</p>

<p>
hearts to do, for me and the rest of the Smith family. Soon I spoke on the
</p>

<p>
stand, but with very oppressed feelings, which, however, I always endeavored
</p>

<p>
not to disclose, while news was arriving from the east, by letters and various
</p>

<p>
other ways, to the Council; and others, containing eulogiums on the boasted
</p>

<p>
righteousness of Parley P. Pratt, and condemning the acts of his predecessors
</p>

<p>
in the preaching and government of the church in that section of the country,
</p>

<p>
when it is well known by all the eastern Saints that when those men went on
</p>

<p>
all was peace and harmony, and that I had labored hard for three years to
</p>

<p>
build up the church, and for the last year to wrest it from the influence of
</p>

<p>
"..." And further it can be proved that B. Young and P. P. Pratt were
</p>

<p>
the first to preach and to practice the "..." doctrine, in the city
</p>

<p>
of Boston and other places, my descent from any such doctrine of course gave
</p>

<p>
annoyance, as did also my exclaiming against the too common practice among the
</p>

<p>
elders of using profane oaths. I earnestly appealed to them as to whether it
</p>

<p>
could possibly by consonant with the garb of a minister of the gospel, of
</p>

<p>
those who build Temples and Nauvoo Houses, thus to indulge in improper
</p>

<p>
swearing. That the Lord would not prosper their proceedings in such a spirit,
</p>

<p>
nor would they inherit a temporal or spiritual salvation. In this appeal I was
</p>

<p>
opposed by John E. Page. On another occasion I spoke in behalf of sister Emma,
</p>

<p>
and the claims of the Smith family, but this was generally laughed at. I
</p>

<p>
opposed also the whittling, whistling, and beastly anointing, practiced upon
</p>

<p>
strangers, and driving away from Nauvoo the doctors and lawyers, telling them,
</p>

<p>
which I did in a spirit of warning, that such courses must bring swift
</p>

<p>
destruction on the people. In return for these good intentions I was called a
</p>

<p>
dissenter, and the charge brought against me of trying to raise a division in
</p>

<p>
the church. My remarks had little or no effect, for again and again it was
</p>

<p>
repeated on the stand by Kimble, Young, Taylor, and others, that lawyers must
</p>

<p>
leave, for it was then a time of peace, and that if they did not they should
</p>

<p>
be offered as a sacrifice of smoking meat, as was practiced by the heathens in
</p>

<p>
ancient times, to appease the wrath of some evil spirit, and that as for the
</p>

<p>
doctors they were all a perfect nuisance. To all these elevated and charitable
</p>

<p>
thoughts and expressions, the congregation responded "..." All this was
</p>

<p>
entirely repugnant to my feelings and I could not avoid manifesting my
</p>

<p>
dissent; the consequence was, that I was informed I had better look out, or I
</p>

<p>
should be cut off from the church. It was a sacrifice indeed to be silent.
</p>

<p>
It was about this time that the Hodge affair took place, and I verily believe
</p>

<p>
that the very men who were engaged in that horrid murder were the most
</p>

<p>
efficient in doing all they possibly could to get the Hodges' hanged, and to
</p>

<p>
get Amos Hodge into the territory of Iowa, that he might share the fate of his
</p>

<p>
brothers, whether guilty or not. But to return to the matters of the church, I
</p>

<p>
published a short notice on the subject of the office of patriarch: very soon
</p>

<p>
it was scanned and criticised, and without even my knowledge or consent, the
</p>

<p>
office declared to be equal only to any common father over his family; which
</p>

<p>
was all a perfect burlesque on common sense, robbing me of my lawful rights in
</p>

<p>
the Smith family, rights by lineage, etc. The phrase "..."
</p>

<p>
become a common byword, a matter of sport on the stand, and in private council
</p>

<p>
a laugh. Mother Smith's mind being greatly wrought upon by these troubles, was
</p>

<p>
carried away in a vision, and on her relation of what she had seen. Brigham
</p>

<p>
Young had the refinement of feeling and consideration to ridicule on the stand
</p>

<p>
the whole matter and marveled that the church could entertain for a moment the
</p>

<p>
crazy manifestations of an old woman. Such remarks, be it borne in mind,
</p>

<p>
proceeded from one who pretends to hold the key of telling where the royal
</p>

<p>
blood is, and claims a standing at the head of a church raised up by a
</p>

<p>
prophet, of whom mother Smith was the parent, and which mother had passed
</p>

<p>
through whole seas of affliction. A copy of this vision will soon appear, and
</p>

<p>
then we shall see and understand the value of the priesthood of that
</p>

<p>
individual who can thus talk of mother Smith, as also of the propriety of a
</p>

<p>
certain John Smith and others who find it to their interest to ridicule rather
</p>

<p>
than reflect. But to return from this digression. I took it upon me to counsel
</p>

<p>
the police of the city, advise them to be more merciful, and not hasten men
</p>

<p>
into Iowa to be hanged, but to give them a chance with others whom I believe
</p>

<p>
to be equally guilty. I received for answer to my advice and counsel, from one
</p>

<p>
of the police, that he did not care a d__n for anything I had to say; that he
</p>

<p>
had received his instructions, and should carry them out. Although some words
</p>

<p>
passed on the occasion, I believe this particular member of the police was
</p>

<p>
innocent of any intentional harm. The result again of this was, that I was
</p>

<p>
cautioned to look out for my life.
</p>

<p>
A horrid circumstance took place on the following evening, which I must
</p>

<p>
relate. -- Arvine [sic] Hodge was crossing a field-path to his lodgings, when
</p>

<p>
he was waylaid and killed, being cut, beat, and mangled in a most shocking
</p>

<p>
manner, within twenty rods of Brigham Young's house, which at the time was
</p>

<p>
surrounded by his own personal police guard, who, as some of them
</p>

<p>
acknowledged, stood within fifty yards of where the murder was committed, and
</p>

<p>
distinctly heard the murderous blows, and the cries of the victim. Sister
</p>

<p>
Young, also, said that she heard them more than once. Young was not at home
</p>

<p>
when the deed was done, but, it is said that in honor to him the murdered man
</p>

<p>
with cries for help, ran some twenty rods, and fell in the road before the
</p>

<p>
house and expired.
</p>

<p>
It is said that although he had his senses til the last, he would say no more
</p>

<p>
about his murderer than that he was a friend; and called on Young to lay hands
</p>

<p>
upon him. This story was told by Young's police, who, be it remembered, stood
</p>

<p>
within fifty yards of where this awful murder was perpetrated, who heard the
</p>

<p>
blows given, and also the cries for help, but who, at the same time, saw no
</p>

<p>
man or men, who could have performed the awful deed.
</p>

<p>
It will be recollected that, on the examination, it was ascertained that
</p>

<p>
Arvine Hodge had received four fatal stabs in the side, each blow sundering a
</p>

<p>
rib, and sufficient to cause instant death, besides the appearance of cruel
</p>

<p>
bruises made by heavy clubs upon the head. It is true no doubt that he
</p>

<p>
struggled hard for life, but is it probable, I would ask, that with such fatal
</p>

<p>
wounds from the knife, and heavy blows from the assassin's clubs, that he
</p>

<p>
could have retained physical strength enough to run for aid, or mental power
</p>

<p>
enough to ask for the laying on of hands? And especially for one whom he had
</p>

<p>
every reason to believe to be his most inveterate enemy? It was at this
</p>

<p>
juncture of these sad proceedings, that the information reached my ears,
</p>

<p>
advising me to keep a good guard about my house, or I might very probably
</p>

<p>
share the fate of Arvine Hodge. In consequence of such information, I summoned
</p>

<p>
my kind friends who watched over my safety for two or three weeks; The
</p>

<p>
necessity of my doing this prompted me to write a letter to B. Young, stating
</p>

<p>
to him that I did not feel my safe in the hands of his police. The answer
</p>

<p>
returned to me was from John Taylor, to the effect that I should meet the
</p>

<p>
council the same day at six o'clock in the evening. Accordingly at the hour
</p>

<p>
specified, I repaired to the place of meeting, not expecting, however, to find
</p>

<p>
any one present save the "..." or the Bishops. But on entering the room on
</p>

<p>
the third story of the Masonic Hall, what was my surprize to find some fifty
</p>

<p>
or sixty policemen all armed with their Bowie knives, pistols, and hickory
</p>

<p>
clubs. How much more too, was my surprize, when after my entrance I found the
</p>

<p>
door guarded, and the man whom I had supposed a particular friend of mine,
</p>

<p>
chuckling with sparkling eyes to think he had me in his power.
</p>

<p>
I was called upon by Brigham Young to make known my grievances. I answered the
</p>

<p>
call, and in fervent tones both long and loud, spoke of my grievances and of
</p>

<p>
my two brothers' deaths, and of the almost entire desolation of the remnant of
</p>

<p>
my father's family; -- that I had returned from a long mission, and wished to
</p>

<p>
settle in the land of my ancestors, and that where the bodies of my brother's
</p>

<p>
lay, I wished to live in peace, and claim the protection due to me. I told
</p>

<p>
them that I considered my right to teach the church altogether unimpeachable;
</p>

<p>
as was also my right to counsel the police, and to assist in controlling the
</p>

<p>
public sentiment. Further, that if the brethren did not want me or my
</p>

<p>
councils, to announce such a sentiment and I would leave them. Let, said I,
</p>

<p>
the Twelve say so -- Let the Bishops say so -- Let the police say so, and I am
</p>

<p>
gone! But mark it, said I, where I go, there also the Smith family go, and
</p>

<p>
with them also goes the Priesthood.
</p>

<p>
After I had spoken for nearly an hour to the foregoing purpose, Brigham Young
</p>

<p>
arose, and although when he came into the room he had given me his hand, with
</p>

<p>
a smiling countenance, launched forth in the following strain, with boisterous
</p>

<p>
boldness:
</p>

<p>
"..." and strange to say all the police
</p>

<p>
and the bishops, and the "..." who were present, said thereunto, "..."
</p>

<p>
The conclusion I drew from all this was, that it was an intentional hint to me
</p>

<p>
that I had better leave. Furthermore he stated that Joseph Smith had revealed
</p>

<p>
to him a mystery concerning the Royal Blood, that none of the rest of his
</p>

<p>
brethren knew anything about; that little Joseph his eldest son was not the
</p>

<p>
prophet of the church, nor ever would be, and that if he were to say so, it
</p>

<p>
would be aiming a dagger at his life's blood. What reflection could possibly
</p>

<p>
suggest itself to me, after such a statement? What else then that he was an
</p>

<p>
ambitious and an ungrateful tyrant? It was now almost dark when I arose and
</p>

<p>
made a few corrections -- the brow-storm grew more palpable, not a smile, not
</p>

<p>
a pleasant look greeted me, as I looked around on my old associates. Among
</p>

<p>
those in the house I observed fifty or sixty of my well known brethren, but
</p>

<p>
not one smile, amen, or consoling word reached me. I tempered my remarks as
</p>

<p>
well and as charitably as I could: which forbearance was answered with remarks
</p>

<p>
from Young to the effect that the police were good men, and obedient to the
</p>

<p>
council.
</p>

<p>
Various circumstances induced me to believe myself hedged in, and I looked at
</p>

<p>
the door, and at the window, but with a very faint hope of escape; it was
</p>

<p>
death to jump from the window, and the armed police prevented all escape from
</p>

<p>
the door, so I sunk back and cried in the very agony of spirit, "..." At this
juncture Brigham Young said, "..." To this I agreed and obtained a vote for my
protection. It was now quite
</p>

<p>
dark, and wagons and carriages were all in readiness, so that with the
</p>

<p>
greatest ease I could have been sent on a long mission, to preach the Gospel.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that I determined to leave to city as soon as possible,
</p>

<p>
and to preserve peace, and avoid any outbreak of feeling, I cautiously kept my
</p>

<p>
own counsel. Rumors however were again spread about by malcontent rivals, that
</p>

<p>
the saints had better be cautiously on their guard; with respect to me, for
</p>

<p>
that I intended neither more nor less than to bring about a division in the
</p>

<p>
Church. It was to allay the feeling that such reports might excite that I
</p>

<p>
preached the notorious, so called, "..." sermon, a discourse so
</p>

<p>
modified however as to be perfectly consonant with my own feelings, and
</p>

<p>
entirely unobjectionable to the pure principles of morality and religion. I
</p>

<p>
had another object in this which was to expose to the light the principles of
</p>

<p>
men who delighted to practice in private that which in public they strenuously
</p>

<p>
deprecated. The talk however still continued 'look out,' 'look out,' and
</p>

<p>
efforts were still made to render my position as disagreeable and unhappy as
</p>

<p>
possible. I still continued on in the consciousness of the purity of my
</p>

<p>
motives, and did not reveal my wounded feelings even to my mother, though all
</p>

<p>
the time the malevolence of my rivals was aiming shafts at me, by spreading
</p>

<p>
tales even so far back as my very boyhood, in connection with my brother
</p>

<p>
Joseph, things which had been passed into oblivion long, long ago. --
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, so strong was the spirit of prejudice that brethren and sisters
</p>

<p>
were even advised to go to others instead of to me to obtain their spiritual
</p>

<p>
blessings.
</p>

<p>
A libelous article was published by John Taylor, on my Patriarchal office,
</p>

<p>
which reached my mother's ears and occasioned her much mental trouble, and
</p>

<p>
loss of rest. To such an extent was her mind affected that she sent to find
</p>

<p>
me, and when I entered her room, she exclaimed, "..." A singular coincidence
with the very situation in
</p>

<p>
which I had been placed, but which had been kept entirely secret from her.
</p>

<p>
From this time the Saints may understand that the proceedings of those who had
</p>

<p>
assumed the authority were kept entirely hidden from me. The disposition of
</p>

<p>
the Temple funds, counseling with regard to the affairs of the church, I have
</p>

<p>
had nothing to do with. Other men have been sought out to act in my place,
</p>

<p>
without the thought of waiting for "..." All these things
</p>

<p>
combined together served to convince me that a conspiracy had been entered
</p>

<p>
into, to disrobe me of my power, and I learned that all the quorums of the
</p>

<p>
church had agreed to sustain Brigham Young by their votes and influence, as
</p>

<p>
the perpetual head of the church, and sole control of its matters. That the
</p>

<p>
church funds have been misapplied, I have no hesitation in asserting, for of
</p>

<p>
necessity I have been made acquainted with the fact, that several houses have
</p>

<p>
been filled up with women who have been secretly married to Brigham Young, H.
</p>

<p>
C. Kimble, and Willard Richards -- women with little children in their arms,
</p>

<p>
who had no means of support except from the tithing funds.
</p>

<p>
And now brethren, I leave it to you to say what shall be done? My counsel is
</p>

<p>
that you at once stop tithing; further my sincere and earnest advice is that
</p>

<p>
the brethren locate themselves in all large branches of the church throughout
</p>

<p>
the United States, remembering that America is the land of Zion, the land
</p>

<p>
promised to the seed of Joseph. Furthermore let the brethren content
</p>

<p>
themselves by building up plain and comfortable meeting houses for the worship
</p>

<p>
of the Lord, until we can [inhabit] the temples we have built, and let all
</p>

<p>
honest saints remain at their homes, and not be led astray by false hopes and
</p>

<p>
promises, either to California or elsewhere. I am told that the plans of
</p>

<p>
getting the tabernacle canvas was all concocted in secret, and with the
</p>

<p>
ultimate intention of appropriating the same for the construction of tents to
</p>

<p>
be used in traveling. What think you now my brethren of "..."
</p>

<p>
None so holy as these men, yet nothing too knavish or underhanded for them to
</p>

<p>
perform.
</p>

<p>
In noticing the claims of Brigham Young to superior power and authority, I
</p>

<p>
would here observe that I heard my brother Joseph declare before his death,
</p>

<p>
that Brigham Young was a man, whose passions, if unrestrained, were calculated
</p>

<p>
to make him the most licentious man in the world, and should the time ever
</p>

<p>
come, said he, that this man should lead the church, he would certainly lead
</p>

<p>
it to destruction. What, my brethren, I would ask you, are the claims of
</p>

<p>
Brigham Young to the keys of the church, above the rest of the Twelve? They
</p>

<p>
are keys which Joseph never conferred on Brigham Young, nor was power ever
</p>

<p>
given to him to lead the church in his place as his successor. The church is
</p>

<p>
hereby warned against any such pretensions, as little Joseph, the son of
</p>

<p>
Joseph Smith is the lawful heir to the officer, being the oldest son of the
</p>

<p>
deceased prophet. I was present with Joseph at the last council that was held
</p>

<p>
previous to the Twelve and others going on their electioneering campaign to
</p>

<p>
the east and various other parts of the United States; it was at this time
</p>

<p>
that I receive my initiation into the highest priesthood lodge, was washed and
</p>

<p>
anointed, and clad with the sacerdotal robe of pure white, and ordained to be
</p>

<p>
priest and king, and invested with all the power that any man on earth ever
</p>

<p>
did possess; power entitling me to preach the gospel, to bind up the kingdom
</p>

<p>
of God on earth, among all nations, and people of every tongue. In consequence
</p>

<p>
of these endowments and ordination received from under the hands of Joseph, I
</p>

<p>
hold as much power and as many keys to seal and bind on earth, as can possibly
</p>

<p>
belong to Brigham Young; this power was conferred equally on all the Twelve,
</p>

<p>
and not therefore bestowed on one. The brethren must understand, too, that
</p>

<p>
Brigham Young holds the presidency over the eleven men by age merely, and not
</p>

<p>
by any legitimate authority, neither has he any superior keys; and the saints
</p>

<p>
will bear in mind that a presidency over twelve men, admitted out of courtesy
</p>

<p>
to age, does not make a man president, prophet, seer revelator, and perpetual
</p>

<p>
head of the church, over a whole dynasty of people, to the exclusion of the
</p>

<p>
lawful heir, the heir by blood and by lineage. Brethren, let my true position
</p>

<p>
be known to you; reflect and you will clearly see that Brigham Young is not
</p>

<p>
lawfully or legally the prophet or head of the church, and that to claim such
</p>

<p>
a right is usurpation and an act of tyranny; it is robbing the innocent -- the
</p>

<p>
widow and the fatherless. Further, the saints are informed that the old
</p>

<p>
pioneers, fathers and founders of this church of Christ in this last
</p>

<p>
dispensation, namely the Smith family, must and will stand at the head, as
</p>

<p>
leaders of this dispensation in time and in eternity. According to our book of
</p>

<p>
covenants, the priesthood must be handed down from father to son.
</p>

<p>
Again, the position of the "..." is defined in the same book, as merely a
</p>

<p>
"..." to open and make known the kingdom abroad, and not as
</p>

<p>
a local presidency. Since the death of Joseph and Hiram, the church has never
</p>

<p>
been organized, although the materials have been all on hand. Its present
</p>

<p>
condition is that of a headless body. It cannot be perfect until there are
</p>

<p>
three presidents. It is just as needful that the church have all its members,
</p>

<p>
with a head to govern it, now as in the days of Joseph, or many years ago.
</p>

<p>
Temples therefore reared up, and endowments given, by usurpers, or by a
</p>

<p>
headless body, can be no other than imperfect. And is not probable, I would
</p>

<p>
ask, that Temples, Nauvoo Houses and other buildings, however richly wrought
</p>

<p>
and gorgeously and sumptuously furnished, such palaces may be reared up in
</p>

<p>
wickedness, by means of cheating and defrauding the poor, by keeping up secret
</p>

<p>
combinations for robbing and plundering the Gentiles -- a Gadiantan Band --
</p>

<p>
altogether contrary to the XXBOOKOFMORMON, how, I would ask, can it be
</p>

<p>
expected that the Almighty will bless or suffer to prosper. How, I would ask,
</p>

<p>
can it be expected that Divine endowments can be given in such houses, or that
</p>

<p>
God will ever bless such a priesthood or such a people. It is this secret
</p>

<p>
combination that has concocted the California expedition, and that are the
</p>

<p>
present ruling authorities of Nauvoo, and the assumed directors of the church,
</p>

<p>
to whom thousands are looking for their endowments. Mark me, many and honest
</p>

<p>
saint will bitterly rue they ever followed the advice of such counselors, and
</p>

<p>
the more especially should they wander with such men into the wilds of the
</p>

<p>
forest, and there become, as they assuredly would, slaves, yea even more, a
</p>

<p>
prey to the beastly passions of tyrants, deprived altogether of the sweets of
</p>

<p>
liberty and the freedom of speech. I heard Brigham Young say not long since,
</p>

<p>
and the remark made my blood run cold, that, the man that did not comply with
</p>

<p>
the measures established by them in that land his head should come off, or at
</p>

<p>
all events none should return to tell their tales. These men will tell you
</p>

<p>
stories of peace and plenty, but I warn you to believe them not; they will
</p>

<p>
tell you of a land of liberty, and call it the "..." they will talk of raising
a standard of freedom for the
</p>

<p>
oppressed, and tell you, you will enjoy liberty, sweet liberty; they will tell
</p>

<p>
you all these things and much more, till once they get you within their grasp.
</p>

<p>
Then, my brethren and sisters you will be robbed by them of all that is
</p>

<p>
virtuous and good; also of your property, and if need be, even of your lives.
</p>

<p>
Less than five or ten years will reveal the sad tale of the utter ruin of all
</p>

<p>
that engaged in this venturesome and hazardous expedition. No matter my
</p>

<p>
brethren, what may be represented to you as boastful perfections and imaginary
</p>

<p>
beauties and qualities, of the self-styled "..." or "..." and their building
temples in the moon, or in the dark and deep
</p>

<p>
wilderness, thousands of miles away from all the inhabitants or civilized
</p>

<p>
life. All such fanciful notions must necessarily fade away like the airy
</p>

<p>
visions of heathen worshippers, to sink and rise no more; yes, like the
</p>

<p>
crumbled ruins of decayed and burnt up cities -- or like the "..." hid
</p>

<p>
up in the corner stones, or like the deposited parchments of ancient days,
</p>

<p>
declaratory of the greatness of certain self righteous men, seen in Heavenly
</p>

<p>
visions, or more properly in the mental wanderings of filthy daylight
</p>

<p>
dreamers, with their one hundred and one temples; all such things must come as
</p>

<p>
far short of the truth of an eternal reality, as will the power of the evil
</p>

<p>
one in dispossessing the righteousness of God, and possessing the kingdom for
</p>

<p>
ever. Let the Elders understand this, and proclaim against it, in the fear of
</p>

<p>
God, and thus save the souls of men from ruin. Follow no such spirits, my
</p>

<p>
brethren but follow such men as Hyram and Joseph, Peter and Jesus, and all
</p>

<p>
such spirits as do justice, in that respect the rights of all men, and
</p>

<p>
especially of the widow and the fatherless.
</p>

<p>
It is astonishing indeed to see the religious chicanery and hypocrisy of those
</p>

<p>
men. In the first place Adams comes on east, bearing letters from Willard
</p>

<p>
Richards and the Council of Nauvoo, announcing the deaths of Hiram and Joseph
</p>

<p>
Smith, to the scattering "..." with advice to me not to return at present
</p>

<p>
to Nauvoo, for fear of increasing the excitement; thus by my absence enabling
</p>

<p>
them to use all efforts, to get the Church bound up to Brigham Young, as its
</p>

<p>
president; the rest of the Twelve resigning all their power into his hands,
</p>

<p>
and thereby rendering themselves powerless.
</p>

<p>
Thus they thought to get a dig at me, having the bishops ready to say "..."
</p>

<p>
with a police bound by covenants and oaths to protect the said Brigham Young,
</p>

<p>
as the president and head of the church, and to carry out all his measures.
</p>

<p>
While this Brigham Young was pampering the church with the idea that although
</p>

<p>
little Joseph was the rightful heir to the priesthood, and office of his
</p>

<p>
father as prophet, seer, and revelator, that it was not prudent to mention
</p>

<p>
this for fear of the little child's life. This was the talk to me, and was one
</p>

<p>
reason why I made the declaration of my satisfaction, still being anxious to
</p>

<p>
believe these men honest. At another time I spoke of the church being without
</p>

<p>
a head, three Presidents, etc., etc., but such observations were treated with
</p>

<p>
lightness and as being of no consideration. And although the matter was
</p>

<p>
dropped for a time, I still heard and saw, and every day's proceeding
</p>

<p>
convinced me, that something was radically wrong.
</p>

<p>
The impression that B. Young was the successor and had even more power than
</p>

<p>
Joseph, that things prospered better, etc., etc., was spread about in all
</p>

<p>
directions. -- And to complete this man's reign of power, there was adopted,
</p>

<p>
as I have before alluded to, the system of spiritual wifery, which was entered
</p>

<p>
into secretly: and directions given to John Taylor and others to proclaim on
</p>

<p>
the stand that all saints should call on Brigham Young for counsel
</p>

<p>
notwithstanding I was by right a counselor of the church. It was, my brethren,
</p>

<p>
in this way, that the cords were drawn tighter and closer. Men's wives and
</p>

<p>
daughters were secretly married at night-time to this Young, H. C. Kimball,
</p>

<p>
William Richards, and others, and, in the dark night, were attending the
</p>

<p>
secret lodges, until most of the "..." were thus sealed and bound under
</p>

<p>
a cloak of adopting children into their kingdoms.
</p>

<p>
All these measures were profoundly secret, and the actors were bound to
</p>

<p>
protect the noble fathers and lords. In addition to this every exertion was
</p>

<p>
made to ordain every one in the shape of man, and induce them to join the
</p>

<p>
"..." and thus become adopted "..." As soon as they had been
</p>

<p>
induced to take the step, they soon found a reason for being no longer
</p>

<p>
Smithites. Still while all these iniquitous proceedings were going on, it was
</p>

<p>
the common practice for these wicked plotters to boldly and blasphemously
</p>

<p>
proclaim before people, in the presence, too of hundreds that have been
</p>

<p>
"..." to them, that such a doctrine was false, and he that practiced it
</p>

<p>
was a scoundrel and the woman that admitted it no other than a harlot.
</p>

<p>
I declare to you, my brethren, that I heard John Taylor proclaim this on one
</p>

<p>
occasion, so vociferously as almost to turn him black in the face, while in a
</p>

<p>
day or two afterwards he was seen sneaking through a garden, to get into a
</p>

<p>
house by the back way to visit his "..."
</p>

<p>
These have been the proceedings at Nauvoo for the last five months, these have
</p>

<p>
been the practices in contradistinction to professions. The very doctrines
</p>

<p>
they would teach and practice in secret, they would make use of to ruin,
</p>

<p>
before the public, those who would not become their servants and their slaves.
</p>

<p>
And now, my brethren and sisters, I again call on you, and especially on
</p>

<p>
those, if there be any, who still remember the claims of little Joseph, and
</p>

<p>
who have still respect for the memory of the martyrs Joseph and Hyrum, who can
</p>

<p>
still sigh when they think of their deaths. I call upon you, I say, to come
</p>

<p>
out of this Brigham Young's power, and to denounce his claims and pretensions,
</p>

<p>
for be assured, they are not of God. Discard, my friends, all such hypocrisy
</p>

<p>
and secret works, all such deeds of darkness. For Gadiantan Bands, secret
</p>

<p>
combinations to murder, and plunder the gentiles, and trespass upon other
</p>

<p>
men's rights, by discarding the marriage contract, can do nothing else than
</p>

<p>
establish licentiousness, and corrupt the mortals of the rising generation.
</p>

<p>
From all such abominations I proclaim myself free and independent, and I
</p>

<p>
implore my friends again and again, especially those of the Smith family, to
</p>

<p>
fly from this sink of iniquity and abomination, and assist in reorganizing the
</p>

<p>
church of God on the old and pure gospel of Mormonism, and in accordance with
</p>

<p>
the XXBOOKOFMORMON, the Bible, and the Book of Doctrine and Covenants. Bear in
</p>

<p>
mind my friends that all this I speak from the deepest feelings of my heart,
</p>

<p>
as the brother of the murdered martyrs, and the representative of the
</p>

<p>
remaining remnants of the Smith family. It is now more than eighteen years
</p>

<p>
that I have borne the storms of a persecuting world, in the firm and confident
</p>

<p>
belief of the Mormon religion, as taught and practised by my brothers Joseph
</p>

<p>
and Hyrum, and by my father, ever since the hiding of the golden plates from
</p>

<p>
which the XXBOOKOFMORMON was translated. And to be told now that I am to have
</p>

<p>
no control over the church of Christ, but that it is to be controlled and
</p>

<p>
counseled by others, is not only palpable and gross in justice, but wicked in
</p>

<p>
the sight of the Lord. It is my intention to appoint, in due time, a
</p>

<p>
conference for the consideration of these and all other matters, of which due
</p>

<p>
notice will be given to all.
</p>

<p>
I ought to have mentioned in a former place, that on one occasion, I heard
</p>

<p>
Brigham Young say, on the stand, that he was glad Alvine Hodge was killed, and
</p>

<p>
that he considered those who would follow the assassins even to the
</p>

<p>
Mississippi river, were neither more nor less than fools, and that he hoped
</p>

<p>
all such men would "..." That in the territory of
</p>

<p>
Iowa, murderers had been hanged and he knew it, though he did not think proper
</p>

<p>
to tell his hearers how, he knew it. And he said further that it was far
</p>

<p>
better for Alvine [sic] Hodge to die, than to live any longer in sin, for that
</p>

<p>
he might now possibly be redeemed in the eternal world. That his murderers had
</p>

<p>
done even a deed of charity for that such a man deserved to die. This as I
</p>

<p>
before observed was stated on the public stand, and I leave the public to
</p>

<p>
estimate the spirit in which they were made, and to draw their own conclusions
</p>

<p>
as to whose counsel, and by what hands, the Hodges met their death, and their
</p>

<p>
brother Alvine murdered in the streets of Nauvoo -- the victim dying in this
</p>

<p>
noble lord's door-yard.
</p>

<p>
Another matter may not be omitted, namely: that Brigham Young, John Taylor,
</p>

<p>
and Willard Richards with the appointed bishops have assumed the publishing of
</p>

<p>
the Church Documents, the Book of Covenants, and also Joseph's private
</p>

<p>
history, as their own property entirely regardless of the rights of the Smith
</p>

<p>
family as therewith connected.
</p>

<p>
Again, in addition to all this assumption of power they have combined
</p>

<p>
themselves into secret lodges, councils, etc., where they concoct all their
</p>

<p>
plans unknown to the common people of the church, out of this have arisen the
</p>

<p>
whitling and whistling societies for disposing of strangers, and the beastly
</p>

<p>
annointing of all who oppose their plans. With this council I am told, the
</p>

<p>
Indians hold a correspondence, and men are frequently rent to colleague with
</p>

<p>
them. Some three or four are now on a visit to the western tribes. Of late,
</p>

<p>
one of their number of the name of Dunham, died among the Indians; he went by
</p>

<p>
the name of "..." and was known by that cognomen among many of the
</p>

<p>
Mormons. On the company to which he belonged returning to Nauvoo, a portion of
</p>

<p>
them were sent to the east, for the purpose of raising men for a general
</p>

<p>
campaign among the Indians, to be entitled 'secret braves.' The names of these
</p>

<p>
men can easily be had. The circumstances under which I left Nauvoo are such,
</p>

<p>
that I feel it a duty thus to lay them before my friends and brethren. I did
</p>

<p>
not leave that place too soon, for the very day of my departure it was
</p>

<p>
whispered to me that a secret plot was already concocted for taking away my
</p>

<p>
life.
</p>

<p>
The saints then, will see from the foregoing, that although it was my
</p>

<p>
privilege to act as counselor to the church, and as patriarch over the whole
</p>

<p>
church, in the place of my brother Hyrum, a fact, with regard to right, which
</p>

<p>
had been over and over again admitted, as the brethren must all well remember.
</p>

<p>
But now how have things changed? All the acts of those who have usurped the
</p>

<p>
power have been most illiberal and uncharitable towards me, and the most
</p>

<p>
flagrant outrage of rights as well as the breaking of sacred covenants have
</p>

<p>
plainly shown their treachery and deceit.
</p>

<p>
All these things combine with their secret combinations, I conceive to be
</p>

<p>
ample cause to induce me to disfellowship such men, and to denounce all their
</p>

<p>
measures. Deprived of the right of acting as counselor of the saints during
</p>

<p>
the last summer, I have been obliged to sit down in silence, and permit
</p>

<p>
iniquity; anarchy and oppression to go on unrestrained. I feel as though I
</p>

<p>
would even now shrink from the task of exposing these matters, were it not for
</p>

<p>
the promptings of duty, and a hope that good may ultimately result -- I leave
</p>

<p>
the event with God While I write to you, my brethren, the feeling that I have
</p>

<p>
been wronged and abused, is struggling for the mastery. With full confidence
</p>

<p>
however, I leave it to my friends, and the friends of justice to say, whether
</p>

<p>
or not, after all the labors of my father's family, of my brother Joseph in
</p>

<p>
particular, to build up the church of Christ, after all the sacrifices made by
</p>

<p>
them, and the privations and persecutions endured by them, I leave it, I say,
</p>

<p>
to all feeling and honest hearts, to pronounce whether or not men who never
</p>

<p>
saw or knew Joseph Smith, until all such sacrifices have been made; should
</p>

<p>
assume the privilege of casting off the Smith family, and depriving his lineal
</p>

<p>
successors of the right to teach and direct the church and correct its evils.
</p>

<p>
Such a course of proceeding, and by a band of men, too, whose deeds would make
</p>

<p>
"..." and the honest in heart to quake, were they fully
</p>

<p>
exposed to the light. -- Even while I pen these remarks to you I fancy I see
</p>

<p>
the care worn visage of my poor old mother, broken down, as she is and almost
</p>

<p>
worn out with the accumulated troubles of years. I see too, in fancy, three
</p>

<p>
sisters, with their husbands, struggling hard in the midst of poverty;
</p>

<p>
relatives, my friends, who have endured the contumely of the world, and who
</p>

<p>
have had to brave the storm of persecution from the first, in peril, in
</p>

<p>
wretchedness, and in want. To think, I say, of all they have gone through, and
</p>

<p>
that now they should be deprived of all honor and station in the church, have
</p>

<p>
no word of controlment in the affairs of the church, and that those who did
</p>

<p>
seem to have a valor, should be now shut out, cannot possible appear to the
</p>

<p>
brethren as anything else than acts of ingratitude and illiberality. My poor
</p>

<p>
old mother has witnessed (it was not enough) the burial of him who was the
</p>

<p>
partner of her life, of my poor father, the good old patriarch, but his
</p>

<p>
departure to the grave has no effect on the feelings of these usurpers of
</p>

<p>
power, nor has either the melancholy martyrdom of her two sons, my brothers. I
</p>

<p>
feel, brethren, as though I were alone among thousands, and my griefs have
</p>

<p>
remained hidden within my own breast, lest they should disturb the peace of a
</p>

<p>
parent almost within her grave. I have borne these oppressions and wrongs
</p>

<p>
until I feel as though they had eaten into my heart like a devouring worm, and
</p>

<p>
wasted my life away for lack of peace, of rest, and of hope. Night and day
</p>

<p>
prayed I that the bitter cup might pass, but the thought will obtrude itself,
</p>

<p>
of all that has been done, and ungratefully repaid, to my mother, my brethren,
</p>

<p>
and my sisters. I cannot but think of the thousands they have fed and clothed,
</p>

<p>
and of the awful storms of persecution they have waded through, and of the
</p>

<p>
threatenings of death they have boldly faced, in order to build up the church,
</p>

<p>
that now should be imparting spiritual life to millions of souls. I cannot but
</p>

<p>
solemnly think, too, that she who was the mother of the prophet should now, in
</p>

<p>
these evil times, be ridiculed on the public stand. And by the very men over
</p>

<p>
whom she has acted as a mother in the church. These accumulations of sorrow
</p>

<p>
have been to me alone beyond endurance, and my brethren, must pardon any
</p>

<p>
evidence of weakness. Pardon, however, need not be hatred for telling simple
</p>

<p>
and plain truths. "..." is an old and just motto, "..." and respecting it
there cannot need excuse. I anticipate
</p>

<p>
nothing more or less than the hatred of these men to whom I have referred in
</p>

<p>
the foregoing remarks, the vials of their wrath will undoubtedly be poured out
</p>

<p>
on my head, and the bitterest anathemas altered against me, to injure and
</p>

<p>
misrepresent my character and motives. But these things will not be done by
</p>

<p>
any fair and honorable means; drowning men, as saith the proverb, always
</p>

<p>
snatch at straws, and this will be in regard to these matters. By vile means
</p>

<p>
will they seek to accomplish their vile purposes, or as the poets say: "..."
and that "..." "..." Treachery and deceit have been the game played by these
men
</p>

<p>
until they have congregated around them a large body of people to Nauvoo,
</p>

<p>
bound by covenants, promises, and secret oaths, to such an extent as to
</p>

<p>
prevent them from breaking off or leaving these men. It is this by treachery
</p>

<p>
and deceit, that their purposes have to be maintained Notwithstanding all
</p>

<p>
these things, however, let the storm be ever so rough, I am fully prepared for
</p>

<p>
the worst. By the help of God, I shall outride the tempest. Their mercy or
</p>

<p>
their pity I solicit not; I look upon them as a disorganized body, without
</p>

<p>
power to save, curse, or damn. Without power, also, to "..." Their acts,
</p>

<p>
like wicked spirits, (for as such I regard them) will do only to be numbered
</p>

<p>
with such like spirits in hell; and their deeds of cruelty and acts of
</p>

<p>
injustice will assuredly sink them deeper and deeper in impenetrable darkness
</p>

<p>
forever, unless they repent and restore all that they have taken away from the
</p>

<p>
innocent. Not even a prayer of the murdered victims they have so much gloried
</p>

<p>
in shall be theirs, and the candlestick shall be removed. There is, my
</p>

<p>
brethren, not the slightest cause whatever why the church should have so long
</p>

<p>
remained unorganized, and to be, as it now is, a mere headless body; the
</p>

<p>
causes, however, from the foregoing statement, must now be plainly evident; it
</p>

<p>
is usurpation, tyranny, and wickedness of the blackest dye, that have
</p>

<p>
occasioned it all. Let the brethren read the prophets, and there they will
</p>

<p>
plainly see that Samuel, the prophet, was ordained while he was yet only a
</p>

<p>
child, as was also the prophet Noah. For the truth of these remarks, I refer
</p>

<p>
you to our book of covenants, on lineage, ordinations, etc., etc. Even
</p>

<p>
children were named, and their work and destiny appointed them, by the angel
</p>

<p>
of God, while they were still unborn. It appears evident to me that when,
</p>

<p>
hereafter, souls wake upon heaven, or the eternal world, it will be found that
</p>

<p>
God did not lie, when he declared that in the posterity of Joseph all the
</p>

<p>
nations of the earth should be blessed. And if Joseph does not frown upon
</p>

<p>
those who profess that they are carrying out his measures, while at the same
</p>

<p>
time they are robbing his son of his lawful inheritance, then I have but a
</p>

<p>
poor idea of human justice, or of the moral virtues of the angels in heaven.
</p>

<p>
To digress once more, be it remembered that John Taylor fancied he had done a
</p>

<p>
brave thing when he published his false notions and misstatements with regard
</p>

<p>
to my patriarchal office, at a time when he knew I had not the power of
</p>

<p>
defense, in consequence of the rich and liberally installed virtues of the
</p>

<p>
Nauvoo police. Poor simple man! "..."
</p>

<p>
So he did, but why? Because he was of the royal blood no doubt. But why,
XXTITLEANDNAME, had you not read that Christ was of a branch of the house of
Israel of
</p>

<p>
which branch nothing was said concerning the priesthood? And again, it was not
</p>

<p>
expected that Christ's priesthood should come through the lineage of his
</p>

<p>
mother, but from God. Hence the saints will notice the difference. Joseph
</p>

<p>
Smith inherited his priesthood by lineage, he being a descendant of Joseph,
</p>

<p>
who was sold into Egypt, and the same priesthood is continued from father to
</p>

<p>
son -- as was, also, my patriarchal office inherited from my father and
</p>

<p>
brother Hyrum.
</p>

<p>
And now, brethren, permit me to say, that so long as the sun, moon, and stars
</p>

<p>
perform their successive revolutions, so long both on earth and hereafter,
</p>

<p>
shall I have faith in the doctrine of legal descent, lineage & blood. And the
</p>

<p>
'Twelve' might as well claim to be my father and mother, as to claim to be the
</p>

<p>
authors of my patriarchal priesthood, an office for which I return no thanks
</p>

<p>
to any one on earth, but only to my Father in Heaven. It is an office to which
</p>

<p>
I shall lay claim to the day of my death. It is upon such principles that I
</p>

<p>
take my ground, and hold myself in readiness to meet any fate at the bar of
</p>

<p>
God. The Twelve did not ordain me one of their number, nor decree my lineage
</p>

<p>
in the Smith family, and I shall never suffer myself to be controlled by
</p>

<p>
Brigham Young or any of his coadjutors. It was from a love of peace, my
</p>

<p>
brethren and sisters, and from no other motive, that I have delayed the
</p>

<p>
publication of these remarks. I determined to await till order and quietness
</p>

<p>
were restored to Nauvoo, being unwilling to inflame a wicked and unhallowed
</p>

<p>
mob, to distress the Innocent and unoffending. I well know that there are
</p>

<p>
hundreds of honest Saints, of good and virtuous, and noble spirits, in the
</p>

<p>
city of Nauvoo, respecting whom I hope and pray that they will canvass these
</p>

<p>
things in their minds and snap asunder their present yoke of oppression, and
</p>

<p>
strive to secure to all a just recompense of what is due to them.
</p>

<p>
God knows I wish to do right and to see the church prosper; to this end I have
</p>

<p>
labored for years. My only desire now is that my friends be calm and devote
</p>

<p>
their minds to the cultivation of the spirit of kindness; to do good to all,
</p>

<p>
to deal justly, and to love mercy. The doctrine that the gentiles are a prey
</p>

<p>
to devouring fire, and under the wrath of God, shews nothings but a malignant
</p>

<p>
spirit, the very reverse of the feeling of the Holy Being that died for us on
</p>

<p>
the cross. Let the saints content themselves in different bodies in the
</p>

<p>
different states, and build churches and school houses, for the edification
</p>

<p>
and education of themselves and children, and thus become a delightful people,
</p>

<p>
clad with Gospel grace.
</p>

<p>
And now may the God of peace and abundant mercy abide with all the faithful.
</p>

<p>
May He be present with all the honest in heart, and may He deliver the
</p>

<p>
innocent from all fear, and prompt the pure-minded saint, to come out, and
</p>

<p>
assist in building up the kingdom as it was at the beginning. That Zion may
</p>

<p>
put on her beautiful garments, and see no more the wasting and destruction of
</p>

<p>
her borders. Let the feeling of the heart be to bury every weapon of death,
</p>

<p>
and learn war no more. Ever and anon, my friends and brethren, you will hear
</p>

<p>
from me again. In the mean time permit me to assure you that I am in all
</p>

<p>
sincerity of heart and singleness of purpose your affectionate and devoted
</p>

<p>
brother. Also your earnest fellow-laborer in the gospel.
</p>

<p>
WILLIAM SMITH,
</p>

<p>
One of the "..." and Patriarch of XXCHURCHFULL.
