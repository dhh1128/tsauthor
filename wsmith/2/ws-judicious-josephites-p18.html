About this time a revelation was given for the Church to move to the state of
XXSTATE. Therefore, all preparations were made for emigrating to the West.
Several of the brethren went in the fall before and during the winter; but in
the Spring, myself, my mother, and some of the family went on board of a
canal-boat to Buffalo. We then shipped aboard of a steam-boat, and after a
long and tedious passage, facing many storms, cold winds and rains, we at
length arrived at Fairport, about eleven miles distant from the settlement of
the brethren. I started on foot with Bro. J. Salisbury, to find them. We soon
discovered their place of residence, and with great joy in our hearts we again
conversed with them face to face; while they on their part very gladly
received us and bade us welcome.

Here I found brother Joseph, father and Samuel, who had removed during the
previous winter. Soon after our arrival a conference was held in which the
elders expected to receive additional powers to go forth and preach the
gospel; and of a truth they did receive more strength and were encouraged
through the promises given to them by the prophet. That God would begin from
that very hour to bless them if faithful, with glory, wisdom, dominion and
power.

The Church was now being established according to the pattern as taught by
Christ and his apostles in the New Testament Scriptures, the same blessings
promised by the Savior to his apostles of old, to heal the sick; cast out
devils; to speak in new tongues, and to lay on hands for the reception of the
Holy Spirit, were vouchsafed to all who became the true and faithful followers
of Christ.

The Elders were then scattered and labored in the different parts of the
Lord's vineyard, and the Saints rejoiced much concerning the great work of God
in the last days. Sometime after this, another conference was held in Orange,
where the Elders, Priests, Teachers and Deacons received some general
instructions from the leaders of the Church concerning the priesthood of
Melchizedek, to which they had not as yet been ordained; for they had not
attained to all the power of their mission, or ministry. At this conference I
was ordained a Priest. I had been exclusively engaged in the business of my
office, attending the numerous conferences and visiting the branches to see
that the members were all faithful and that there was no quarreling, or
backbiting among the brethren. During this time my faith was increased and my
resolution to serve the Lord and assist in rolling on his work strengthened,
and I felt determined to devote my time, talents, and energies in furthering
the purposes of God, and spreading his gospel throughout all nations. My
license was as follows:--

<p>
This made me feel more and more importance of my mission and the necessity of
being up and doing while the day lasts, and of magnifying my office. I felt
deeply the responsibility which rested upon me of being a faithful watchman
upon the walls of Zion, and of warning all men of the approach of the Savior.
I accordingly made several circuits into the country round about, in order to
declare unto them the truths of the gospel. I took one mission with my brother
Samuel, into an adjoining county. Also, another one with Don Carlos, my
brother, among some of my friends from York State; besides several other
missions into different parts of the country. Some were aroused to the
necessity of preparing for another world, and repenting of their sins, were
baptized into the Church. I labored in the state of XXSTATE as the Spirit
directed me, until the fall of XXYEAR, when I took a mission with my brother
XXFIRSTNAME, into the western part of XXSTATE, in Elk Creek township, where I
became acquainted with a young lady by the name of Caroline Grant, and after a
short acquaintance married her on the 14th of XXMONTH, XXYEAR. I then returned
to XXCITY and attended the School of the Prophets during the remainder of the
winter.
