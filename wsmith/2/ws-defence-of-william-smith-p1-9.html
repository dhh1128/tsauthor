DEFENCE OF ELDER WILLIAM SMITH, AGAINST THE SLANDERS OF ABRAHAM BURTIS, AND
OTHERS; In which are included several Certificates, and the duties of Members
in the Church of Christ, in settling difficulties one with another, according
to the Law of God.

RESPECTED CHRISTIAN FRIENDS AND BRETHREN, --

As the subject of this text is one of a singular character, it will not be
thought strange or improper I trust, if I introduce the subject of my own
cause and personal abuse as a matter of interest on the present occasion. In
fact, I consider that the circumstances under which I am placed, require some
remarks from me, to rebut the foul aspersions and base calumny, that has been
heaped with an unsparing hand upon me.

It is a fact, lamentable in the history of all ages, that infractions and
divisions, more or less, have risen up in the Church of Christ; which a
cursory examination of the past will prove.

I shall only call your attention to a few examples, and then proceed with
matters connected with my own personal interest.

First. -- Of infractions and divisions, and the various causes that lead to
them, we will find as we trace the sacred volume, were the spirit of envy,
malice, jealousy and hatred, which engenders strife and every other evil work,
and where these are; there is the spirit of lying, persecution and murder,
which the sequel will prove as we pursue. See XXSCRIP.

...

We learn from the above, that a sore and grievous difficulty took place
between two brethren, not only of the flesh, but of the Church of Christ; as
no other Church then existed, and it appears that the principle cause of this
division and murder, was on account of the before mentioned spirit of
jealousy, envy, malice and hatred, which is the spirit of the evil one, or as
Paul terms it, the works of the flesh, hear him. XXSCRIP.

...

We find that where the last qualifications are, there is no strife, no
disunion in the Church, for where the love of God is, there is Charity,

and "..." But wars and fighting whence cometh
they? not from God, neither by the love and Spirit of God, as Paul plainly
tells us. Let us hear him further on this important subject. XXSCRIP.

Here Paul speaks of a party spirit, divisions in the Church of God, as being
incompatible with the Spirit of Christianity, and even thanks God, that he had
baptized none of them, except "..." and "..." because of their contentions and divisions.

These walk not, (where those divisions are,) according to that life, that is
hid with Christ in God, putting off the old man with his deeds, and putting on
the new man Christ Jesus.

Again XXSCRIP: "..."

But let me ask, says one, if offences arise between two brethren, how is this
to be reconciled? Answer. -- Not by entering your complaint to the world,
falling into a rage, and blaspheming the name of the great God, but pursue the
course that Jesus and his Apostle Paul have pointed out. First then, one
testimony against a brother is not sufficient, "..."
See Book of Covenants, page 125. And it becomes necessary to adhere strictly

to the law of God in such cases, to prevent imposition upon the Saints, and
preserve injured innocence. The case of Joseph being sold into Egypt, and
thrown into prison by the false witness of Potiphar's wife, (See XXSCRIP,) shows a sufficient example on this subject, i. e. the testimony of a
single person is not sufficient to condemn a brother of the Church of God, and
respecting an Elder, subjected as they are, to the malice and false
accusations of wicked and ungodly men and women, borne on by a spirit of
hatred and revenge. To prevent such evils, wise provision has been made in the
law of God, upon this subject. Hear Paul concerning the matter. See XXSCRIP;
17 to 19. "..."

...

But if an evil arises, and a brother offends, what is to be done? let us
restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, (not malice, neither in the
rage of a demon,) but let us always adhere to the law of Israel's God. See
XXSCRIP.

...

Again XXSCRIP. "..."

This, then, appears to be the way, and only way to reconcile difficulties
between brethren of the same faith, according to the law of God; but what are
we to think of them that commune with us for years,

that say, Come and welcome, preach for us, give us the hand of fellowship, bid
us farewell when leaving, with cheerful countenances bestow upon us gifts and
blessings, and invite us from distant lands to visit them, and then in an
unexpected hour, in the time of trouble and in the hour of danger, and
affliction, forsake us, and with pretended charges of a long standing, betray
us into the hands of our enemies, this is a mystery I shall leave with the
good intelligence of this audience to explain, and the history of the future
to unfold.

The time to correct wrongs, is evident, at the time the wrong was committed,
and not two years afterwards. For if a man be innocent of a crime, how shall
he know that his brother has aught against him? and when he has committed no
wrong, how shall he make reconciliation against false charges, unless his
brother makes them known to him? Thanks be to the God of Elijah, his law is so
adapted that it meets and reaches the capacity of man under all circumstances,
condemnation to the wicked; but a safeguard to the saints, against all the
shafts of satan, and his emissaries. See XXSCRIP. "..."

We have eat and drank of the bread and wine; that holy communion and sacred
ordinance of the "..." and you must be aware that it is said in
holy writ: "..."

The christian principle supposes that in partaking of the bread and wine
together; If a brother has aught against a brother, if he does not make it
known at the time, it is strongly presumable that he did not consider it an
offence, or a crime sufficiently magnified into a transgression, and that the
brother or sister had been belied, slandered, falsely charged, etc.
Consequently, if he partakes of that holy emblem, it is considered that the
spirit is right. Hence this is the principle and ground that should govern our
judgments, and the only safe law or rule. Therefore, to charge a brother or a
sister with a fault (known any length of time before communion,) afterwards,
the presumption is, that it is false, and that it is the spirit of malice,
envy, hatred, etc., and should not be taken in evidence against a brother or
sister, and cannot be in justice; for it is more than probable, that if there
was any real cause of complaint, the brother or sister would make it known,
and would not have partaken of the communion, for fear of "..." to their own souls.

Almost the last thing before I left, two years ago, was to administer and
partake of the communion, with Burtis and his colleagues, who now charge me
with crimes, said to have been committed long before I left, yet they
communing with me, attending my meetings, and giving me the friendly hand, and
a welcome greeting. Since my return not one word has ever been said to my
face, naming the offence or crime; and how it has been with them this length
of time, according to their own statement, I leave it with you, my friends, to
judge; one thing however is certain, if what they now say be true, they must
acknowledge, that they have acted the part of notorious hypocrites, and that
for the space of two years and a half, a long time to harbour iniquity in the
Church indeed, and this may account for the many violations of church
government, and laws of God, in not following, and observing, the many
christian duties involving upon them. And how many times they have eat and
drank unworthily, is not for me to say.

Therefore I would remind those beam diggers and mote finders of Haman and
Mordecai, that Haman was hung upon his own gallows, although he had prepared
it for Mordecai. "..." "..." "..." (I allude to Burtis and his
emissaries), for they have need, as I trust the sequel will prove. And that
there has been no cause or ground for complaint; but on the contrary, a wicked
and malicious persecution; led on by a spirit of revenge.

This same spirit, we learn from what has been said, occasioned the downfall of
Cain; and a division in the Church in the earlier ages of Christianity, Cain
became jealous, because God had more respect to Abel's offering, than he had
to his; and his heart on account thereof, was filled with hatred, and envy,
and arose up in the spirit of a Demon, and slew his brother.

Thus we see those brethren, Cain and Abel, were once associated together in
the bonds of brotherly love; in the same ministry, for it appears, they both
made an offering, but unto Cain's the Lord had no respect, he being more
selfish than his brother Abel. Therefore, Dear Brethren, marvel not when this
spirit of persecution and revenge is manifest among us, although they may have
attained to the ministry, and been numbered among the servants of God, in
these last days; yet their offering will savor so much of that of Cain's, that
God will not accept it, "..." And again Paul "..."

But it may be said, how can these fall ? -- seeing they have attained to such
glory and inestimable privileges in the Church and ministry, and still say
they, "..." We might ask
with the same propriety; how did Cain fall? (He was an agent to act for
himself, and so were they,) the most plain and conclusive answer, would be; he
fell by transgression; but how did he transgress? Answer, by hating his
brother, because the Lord accepted his brother's offering, and would not his,
(one being offered in righteousness, and the other not,) and so became
jealous, and shed his brother's blood.

Hence they must be separated, never more to be united again on earth, and God
placed a mark upon Cain, that he might be known to all his brethren, "..." And in like manner will God
place a mark on every man that makes or causes a division in the Church of
Christ; and is cut off from that Church, and a hiss, and a bye word, shall he
be.

We find by perusing the sacred writ, that many have believed, and attained to
great things, and afterwards fell, "..."
angels believed and fell and became devils, Peter denied his Lord, although he
said he would not, "..." said he "..."
Judas pretended to believe, yet he fell, became a devil, persecuted and
betrayed his Lord; Paul the Apostle of Jesus, also, was in perils by sea and
land, and among false brethren, such were called by him deceitful workers,
etc., hear him, XXSCRIP.
