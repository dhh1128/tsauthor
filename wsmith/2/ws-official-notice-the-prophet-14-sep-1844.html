Official Notice To the Saints. -- "..." and "..."
"..." It has become my painful
duty, for the rolling on of the cause of truth, to say, that notwithstanding
our brethren have been murdered by false brethren (apostates), by fault
finding saints, that there still remains some who are determined to continue
the work of destruction, deceiving the unwary, and leading off the hearts of
the simple, by charging the servants of God falsely. Among this number is our
once beloved brother Benjamin Winchester, whose course for some two or three
years, has been more or less censurable, (as all the heads of the Church will
bear me witness,) of which a full account will be published hereafter, if
necessary. The object of this brother is best known to himself: he gives as a
reason for his opposition to the constituted authorities of the Church, the
(by him) supposed existence of certain heresies in the Church, charged upon
the heads of a few individuals; and this I consider slanderous, and will
repel. And I hereby notify Elder Benjamin Winchester, that his services are no
longer required in the Church of Jesus Christ, unless he repents, and that he
is forbidden to preach any longer in the name of the XXLDS. "..." And that the
Saints in Philadelphia may know how much confidence they may put in this Lump
of Perfection, let them remember the charges he made in Conference, against
certain brethren in New York, from whom I have received the following
certificate, proving the falsity of said charges.
