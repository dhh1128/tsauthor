MY excuse for writing this preface is a wish to correct errors instilled into
the minds of the people -- by many falsehoods and misrepresentations that book
writers have set afloat concerning the character of XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME,
and the origin of the XXBOOKOFMORMON, regardless of the facts. There is not
one writer, man or woman, of all the books and expositions of Mormonism that I
have read professing to give the history of XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, or the
origin of Mormonism, but what has penned infamous and glaring falsehoods as by
personal knowledge I know. For this reason I ask the reader to divest himself
of prejudice and to read with prayerful and honest heart, and investigate the
evidences and facts set forth in this work. If he will do this he may be
assured that he will become satisfied respecting the calumnies and false
charges brought against the divine mission of XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME. In nine
cases out of ten, persons who have given the Mormon question an impartial
investigation, it has caused them to be friends instead of enemies to the
cause. If the story of the angel's visit to XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, was so
enormously strange as to excite the priesthood of the age to all this calumny
upon the character of the prophet, why should we believe in the angel stories
that are told us in the Bible. Bible believers should know that the whole
Scripture Revelation is founded upon visions and dreams, and angel visits to
man. And why should not God send angels to deliver messages to his servants in
these latter days, as well as in olden times. Readers, read and ponder these
questions and answer them for yourselves, God helping you to choose the right
and to give a righteous judgment, as honest men and women should do. The
strange inconsistency of persons professing to believe the Bible and still
denying what they profess to believe, is plainly seen; for angels, saith the
Scriptures, are ministering spirits to those that are heirs of salvation.

In conclusion, the Church now presided over by XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, the son
of the martyred prophet, has no sympathy nor connection whatever with the
Church of Polygamous Mormons in Utah.
