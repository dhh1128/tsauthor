<p>
To XXTITLEANDNAME XXLASTNAME, of XXCITY: Sir: -- I am in receipt of your
communication per XXTITLEANDNAME, of the 28th inst., and am certainly quite as
much surprised at your attempt to persuade me from a proper line of duty and
principle, as you possibly can be at the mode and manner I have adopted to
resent the injuries I have sustained, and the base ingratitude to which I was
subjected during my sojourn at XXCITY. Have you, sir, not aided and assisted
in robbing me, and those with whom I am connected, of the powers and
privileges in the church to which I was lawfully entitled?
</p>

<p>
As regards the injured feelings of my aged mother to which you have the
baseness and audacity to refer, permit me to say, that you and the balance of
the "..." alone have been the contributor to her sufferings, and could the
gaping wounds of that widowed parent's heart but give utterance, and tell you
the origin and source of her grief, your heart, although petrified and dead to
every principle of charity and gratitude, would soften at the bleeding tale,
and exhibit to you one of the guilty authors of her troubles, and the corrupt
and damning influence which governs and characterizes your present course of
conduct in connexion with the spurious "..." Your contemplated sheet charges
me with being the cause of her grief and trouble, but you are well aware of
the falsity of such an assertion. The treacherous dishonesty and secret
combinations of you and your sycophants, and the unhallowed course of the
present assumed leaders of the Church; have been the sole and only cause; and
had you possessed the least spark of even expiring veracity, or the nobleness
of soul, and sympathy of feeling which characterizes humanity, principle would
have shuddered and justice revoked even an allusion to that subject.
</p>

<p>
I am here as an exile driven from my home, and that, too, by the requisition
of your leaders in secret council, who deliberated upon the necessity of my
murder, and required that the sacrifice of my blood should be made as speedily
as possible. Providence aided me in my escape from the armed assassins, who
were employed by their leader or President XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME. These
statements you will, no doubt, deny; but they are no less true.
</p>

<p>
The arrow of revenge is sharp, and when wielded by the strong arm of a Saint,
will not fall powerless and harmless, at your feet. None have reason to fear
but the guilty wretch who shrinks from the presence of an honest community,
and seeks refuge beyond the power of the law and the order of civilization.
</p>

<p>
You are well advised of the fact, that I have been wronged and robbed by my
pretended friends, among whom I rank your saintly self, and that, too, in an
hour when I had but little reason to anticipate danger. Did you or any one of
your leaders repudiate the operations and secret workings of XXFIRSTNAME
XXLASTNAME to destroy my privileges -- nay, even to destroy his unsuspecting
victim? Oh, no, on the contrary, efforts and influences were used for the
consummation of the outrage which was contemplated against me, by the
diplomatical representative of his satantic majesty.
</p>

<p>
You, in the most barefaced and hypocritical manner invite me to return to
XXCITY. Upon what principle, or based upon what assumption, I am at a loss to
conjecture, except that your wicked Twelve feel too keenly the sting
occasioned by my safe retreat, and that you yet seek the destruction of one
who opposes, in spirit and in truth, the principles and doctrines which are
practised and preached in that city, and sink of iniquity. I look upon you
with as much tenacity as if you were a fallen angel whose heart is
sufficiently black even to darken the gloomiest prison of hell, (not one of
your present colleagues excepted.) And, sir, were you aware of the injuries
and wrongs which your so very kind hearted brethren have committed, and their
secret plottings to rob you of every thing calculated to sweeten life or
render existence desireable, no atonement could heal the wounds inflicted upon
your feelings. You would not hold your peace day or night, nor give rest to
your body, or slumber to your eye-lids, until the iniquitous character and
conduct of your present associates were proclaimed upon the housetops. But,
doubtless, some things for the present must remain a mystery to you, until by
traversing the cheerless wilderness of the west, you awaken as from a reverie.
Then, too, will you find yourself shorn of all power and authority, and
perhaps call to recollection the facts which I have stated in this letter.
Again, I say they have sought with avidity to destroy the temple of virtue,
and sanctity of your happiness. Can you, therefore, after these startling
developments and facts, continue to aid and encourage those robbers of your
domestic happiness, and sworn enemies of your prosperity and welfare? I may,
before I leave this subject, be allowed to intimate to you that XXFIRSTNAME
XXLASTNAME, as well as your assumed President, XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, are any
thing but friends of yours, and time will satisfy you fully of the truth of
this remark, as well as of many that, for the present, are forbidden.
</p>

<p>
I am fully prepared to establish each and every assertion I am now making, and
bid defiance to contradiction, although it is but reasonable to expect that
you[r] co-demons in XXCITY, will attempt a reply and denial of these
statements. But by whom do the chosen heads of the Church consist? Why sir, of
yourself and those who at this time, are a libel and disgrace to humanity,
corrupt in principle, character, conduct and reputation. -- With any honest
man from XXCITY, who will meet me in this city; I am quite ready and willing
to test the strength of my cause, or of my veracity in the pulpit, or to
submit to the deliberations of a jury of my fellow citizens.
</p>

<p>
I have not the least cause to regret the course I am now pursuing. It is for
the cause of virtue, and the result of calm reflection, influenced by a heart
struggling for life and liberty, and revolting against the murder, stratagem
and treason so carefully matured and rocked in that cradle of crime, XXCITY.
If you think that I am so lost, to every principle of honor that I would
surrender one particle of the right which you know legally belongs to me, you
are egregiously in error. I have a spirit which will breathe upon your
organized band of assassins, murders and robbers, a lava which will soon
extinguish the flame of ingratitude now burning against me. This is the first
eruption, and be careful that the volcano of truth does not open with terrible
effect upon your guilty heads; can it be possible that any person possessing
the ordinary capacity of a liberal being can imagine for one moment, that
XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME., or any of the Twelve who are rebels to the original
principles and practices of Mormonism, are in possession of the keys of any
kingdom, except those of the blackest regions of darkness.
</p>

<p>
You remark that you know what my influence is in the Eastern States, and what
I have written. This does not in the slightest degree surprise me, and for
your information, I will say, that I am perfectly well aware of the secret
manner in which you, XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, XXFIRSTNAME XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME,
and the rest of the Twelve, and many others of my (brethren and) pretended
friends, have for some months labored to weaken and destroy the confidence
reposed in me by my brethren at the East. The bite of the adder is poisonous,
and it seeks its prey upon the highway; just so have you and your hypocritical
brethren endeavored to ensnare me into difficulty and crime; but I prefer
being the bitten stranger and injured victim, rather than to dwell (in a den
of snakes) among a set of people who are daily outraging every principle of
morality, and that, too under the most solemn pretended authority from God. I
desire no honors from such a band of pharisees and robbers, as I know many of
these apostolic scoundrels are. Time will fully establish the truth of every
charge I make against them. I am now prepared openly and boldly, to expose
every secret evil which is practised by XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME and his brother
leaders at XXCITY, and elsewhere. I'm not now surrounded by an armed body of
men, employed by the leaders of a Church to destroy the persons and property
of those who honestly differ with them in religious opinion, and are bound by
oaths to murder indiscriminately whoever may oppose the secret and wicked
plans and practices of the immaculate XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME. As a specimen of
the moral degradation existing among you, I will mention XXFIRSTNAME XXINITIAL
XXLASTNAME as a fit subject to introduce. You are well aware that this
unassuming and righteous apostle came from the East, a few days since, in
company with a female whose appearance and conduct bear sufficient evidence of
his utter disregard of virtue or religion. This is not the only crime he is
guilty of. His iniquitous conduct is well known in the East and speaks for
itself. It is needless for me to enlighten you further upon the character of
XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, and many
others who are continually preaching the doctrine, and openly practising
adultery; for this you know too well. Let these dreadful monsters dare to go
to the Eastern States, and I think it would not be long before they would find
out that in some instances "..."
</p>

<p>
You speak of the Keys going with the body of the Church. This I deny. You know
such a statement is false; for the law of God teaches no such thing. On the
contrary, you know that the Keys control and govern the church in every matter
connected with its ecclesiastical government. Where I would ask were the Keys,
the power and blessing of the holy Priesthood, when the multitude of Israel
followed and worshipped the golden Calf. It requires no vision to inform you
that the Keys were in possession of the few, while the multitude followed
their apostate leaders, among whom Aaron was most conspicuous. What was the
result? Did they not have to drink the bitterness of their own folly. Yes,
sir, and ere long the followers of the present despot, XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME
will have to drink a similar draught. -- Scripture and reason teach us that
those who are led by wicked rulers must necessarily be astray, and powerless
as those who govern and direct then; for wicked rulers have neither Priesthood
nor power. My Priesthood was conferred upon me by a higher power than the
iniquitous Twelve. It was conferred by a just God who never errs and who
cannot look upon sin with the slightest degree of allowance of palliation. You
remark, if I have not the influence of the Church I must not indulge the
thought of having the Keys of the Priesthood. Where and in what condition was
the Church when my brother Joseph received his Priesthood? You will certainly
grant that it was conferred upon him by some means, (other than the Church.)
You will no doubt say that I was ordained. So I was; but not by either the
church or the Twelve; for before they were, "..." Admitting, for the sake of
argument, that they ever ordained me it amounts then to a ceremony only, and
by no means conferring any right or power to which I was entitled. For this, I
inherit by lineage, according to the tenets of the original church of XXLDS.
My brother Joseph was also baptised and ordained by XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME. --
Now, sir, you might as well claim, that this man was, or is now the head of
the Church and the author of XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME's Priesthood, as to claim
that the Church or the Twelve are the origin or authors of mine; and what the
Church did not give she cannot take away. I received what I possess, not from
the church, but from the Great Author of the Universe, through my brother
Joseph and father, by ordination and lawful inheritance.
</p>

<p>
I care not for your boasted pretensions to rule, and authority in the church,
for I am independent of any such band of lying hypocrites, as I know the
present rulers to be. They are apostates in every sense of the word from the
true church of Christ and it does not require the aid of revelation to
establish the truth of this statement, (although upon this subject there is an
abundance).
</p>

<p>
Your invitation to return to the quorum of the twelve, I treat with that calm
and dignified scorn which such barefaced hypocrisy justly merits. No sir, I
return no more to such a den of thieves and quorum of iniquity. I am fixed in
my course and firm as the Rock of Gibraltar; and I protest against your
proceedings and conduct. I know there are many friends now in XXCITY who are
afraid to express their opinion, but it will not always be so. As regards the
course I am taking, make yourselves as contented as possible, for I do not
apprehend any alarm as to my success, for I think my chances are quite as
encouraging as yours possibly can be, in the event of your departure to the
wild and cheerless far-west. Your tyrant usurpers will there be shielded from
civilized law, and ere long you will be made to feel the lash of their power.
My life and exertions will be (in order to perpetrate the names of my father's
family and with honor to the noble martyred brothers Joseph and Hiram wipe
away the disgrace, the stain, the evils that, since their deaths, have crept
into the church. And by too frequent use of their names, the twelve are
carrying out the most wicked, base and unhallowed purposes that could be
devised under the cloak of Joseph and Hiram's names. Brethren! be assured that
Joseph or Hiram never would have sanctioned the present wicked plans of the
twelve; their corruption, their sink of iniquity, their removal to the
wilderness, their doctrine of polygamy, usurpation, etc.) exercise for the
redemption of the church to its original purity, and the rights of my father's
and brother's family. I am by no means discouraged, but that I will finally
succeed, I have no doubt. -- I am willing by the help of God to try it, at
least for six years to come.
</p>

<p>
You say that I sent a bundle of pamphlets to the editor of the Signal at
Warsaw. This is a falsehood. If any was sent to that gentleman, I was not
aware of it. -- But I understand what you mean by this. It is done for affect,
as a great many other things are done at XXCITY for the same purpose, such as
fasting and prayer, a proclamation, or an avowal of friendship before the
public, but in secret council sworn and inveterate enemies. Oh shame, where is
thy blush! Look upon these hypocrites and then hide thy face with confusion.
The best evidence we have of a man's friendship is in his works and not in his
professions. Let him that has wronged his brother restore fourfold, or he will
be damned and go to hell. But I am well satisfied that your rascally twelve
can find some scoundrels, enough to condemn and swear away the life of any one
upon whom they wish to be revenged.
</p>

<p>
I will conclude by earnestly hoping that you will come as a humble penitent,
seeking forgiveness, that you may find mercy while it is called to-day. Flee,
I say, flee the wrath to come, and wash your hands of all iniquity, and give
your aid to the re-building of the pure and original principles of the
religion and kingdom of XXJESUSCHRIST, as taught by my brothers Joseph and
Hiram.
</p>

<p>
Your well wisher and friend; in all good works. XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME.
</p>

<p>
Patriarch of the Church.
