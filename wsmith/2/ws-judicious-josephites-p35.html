Among the spiritual gifts named by Paul in Cor. 12:10, is the gift of tongues.
This gift as generally believed by the Church of XXLDS, not only occupies an
important position in the Church, but forms one of the grand auxiliaries of
the spiritual enjoyments of the Saints; as thereby by the Spirit's revelation,
and by the means of the gift of the inter-pretation of tongues, many important
and interesting things are brought to light. It is in this marvelous way that
the song at the head of this chapter entitled "..." was given to Mother Lucy
Smith, sung in spirit and interpreted, as stated. The mother of the prophet
having a firm belief in the XXBOOKOFMORMON, while pondering over the account
in that book of the entire overthrow and destruction of the Nephite race, by
their enemies, at the time the golden plates were hid up in the hill Cumorah,
received of the spirit, and the tongue was given, the words of the song being
translated by the same spirit.

That a better understanding may be had of the overthrow and final destruction
of the Nephite race, and the time of the depositing of the golden plates by
one of the prophets of the ancient aborigines of this American Continent,
</p>

<p>
we give the following account. It would seem from the history of these
aborigines, that they were a warlike people, and becoming divided into two
nations had become spread over both North and South America, one of these
divisions was called Lamanites and dwelt in the country of South America; and
the other division called Nephites, in North America. Each derived its name
and title from individuals of the race, and who at an early time had become
leaders of the respective divisions that had sprung up among them. The history
further relates, that a terrible war commenced between these two nations,
which lasted for many years, and resulted in the complete overthrow of the
Nephites. This war commenced at the Isthmus of Darien, and was more or less
destructive to both nations, until at length the Nephites were driven before
their enemies north and north-east to a great distance; when gathering their
whole nation together both men, women and children, they encamped on and round
about the hill Cumorah near where Palmyra, N. Y., now stands; where the golden
records were found, in the town of Manchester, about four miles on the road
leading from Palmyra to the city of Canandagua. Here the Nephites were met by
the numerous hosts of the Lamanites and were hewn down and slaughtered, both
male and female, aged, middle aged and children. Hundreds of thousands were
slain on both sides, and the nation of the Nephites was destroyed, except a
few who escaped into the south country, and a few others who fell wounded and
were left by the Lamanites on the field of battle for dead; among these were
Mormon and his son Moroni. It was this Mormon, as the history states, who made
an abridgement from the records of his forefathers, upon plates of gold, to
which abridgement he gave the title, The XXBOOKOFMORMON, and being commanded
of God he hid in the hill Cumorah, all the sacred records of his forefathers
in his possession, except the abridgement, called the XXBOOKOFMORMON, which he
gave to his son Moroni to finish. Moroni survived his nation a few years and
continued the writings, in which he informs us that the Lamanites hunted the
few Nephites who escaped the great battle of Cumorah, until they were all
destroyed, excepting those whose were mingled with the Lamanites. Moroni was
left alone, and kept himself hid for fear of the Lamanites, but continued the
history, until the four hundred and twentieth year of the Christian era, when
he hid up the records in the hill Cumorah, until by the ministry of an angel
they were discovered by Joseph Smith, and by the gift of inspiration were
translated into the English language. The names of the witnesses who were
permitted to see and handle these plates after they had been translated, may
be seen by reference to the XXBOOKOFMORMON, kept for sale at the Publishing
Office at Lamoni, Decatur County, Iowa. Here we leave the subject of Moroni as
the story of the song finds and leaves him.
