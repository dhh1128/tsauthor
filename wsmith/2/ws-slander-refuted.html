SLANDER REFUTED!

AN EXTRACT FROM CHURCH PROCEEDINGS;

AND EXPULSION OF

MORMON APOSTATES, FROM THE CHURCH!

Solomon says, "..."

TO THE SAINTS SCATTERED ABROAD, GREETING:

Respected Friends and Brethren,

As this is a day of great developments, and wonderful explosions, it stands
every person in hand, to look well on all sides before they judge. In the
first place we should understand, that when a man has enemies that have sworn
to do him all the injury they can, out of malice and revenge, it will be
expected that all manner of lies will be put into circulation concerning him.

Now I will just suppose a case, and then leave the matter for you to judge.
Suppose you had an enemy, and he was to report five slanders concerning you,
to the injury of your character; and you were to call a council of eight men
of the first respectability, (Elders in Israel) and then prove four of the
slanderous reports to be false; what ought the people to think of the fifth
one? This is exactly the true statement of the case; only, the fifth one was
not known at the time of the council, and never would I presume, if it had not
have been to help these Mormon Apostates to carry out their plans of putting
me down, and that was manufactured out of whole cloth, -- a notorious
falsehood; and now you have to judge between the weight of testimony for me
and the testimony against me, and see which is the strongest, and entitled to
the most credit. I have herein inserted the names of the persons used against
me, and wish to place them along side of the names of the following
councilors, for your inspection and candid judgment.

No. 1. on the list is Zilph Hornor, with three, four or five illegitimate
children in her arms, (She speaks for herself.)

No. 2. Is Sarah Burtis, who was suspended from the fellowship of the church,
for disorderly conduct in meeting, as a mocker, frowner, and other unchristian
conduct, and a liar as the certificates of certain individuals plainly show,
in a pamphlet, entitled "..."

No. 3. A statement that XXTITLEANDNAME says Hannah W. Allen has made, and as I
never saw the statement, and it has never been proven true, I do not know that
Hannah W. Allen, ever attached her name to any such statement, written or
verbal, therefore it amounts to no testimony at all, true or false.

No. 4. The forth and last is Elizabeth Hornor, sister to the first in this
train on the list, and a liar, as the following certificate will prove

Since the council, she makes a different statement, and is reporting
falsehoods concerning me.

The above are the weapons that A. Burtis fights with, worthy weapons indeed!
quite characteristic of his cause. Charles Asson is A. Burtis' right hand man,
that is enough for me, or any reasonable man; for what does he know about
church government, that he should dictate the Elders and condemn the decision
of a council, or A. Burtis either?

Not one of the statements, made by the above named persons, taken all
separately, has ever been proven true, by one, two or three witnesses, as the
law of God requires; consequently they are not entitled to the least credit
whatever. The witness of one person (if true) is not sufficient to condemn an
Elder, without that witness could prove his or her statement by two or three
witnesses and then the testimony is to be weighed and looked upon, according
to the character or credibility of the witness, and if every one of the above
named persons, were to swear to every word that Burtis has said, their
testimony would be entitled to no more credit than what their characters truly
merit; for my own part, I believe it would not amount to much in the minds of
reasonable and judicious men, with Zilph Hornor at the head of the train, and
Charless Asson and A. Burtis, as firemen, with their worthy confederates can
punch up the fire, and raise the steam, on the most approved plan of high
pressure locomotive, go ahead of modern times with every car chained to its
fate, they will (no doubt) soon arrive in port, unless the leading car should
run off the track; which depends very much on the management of the head
engineers.

But lest there be a bursting of boilers, I have concluded not to take passage
on this train, for the fare, 12 1/2 cents, is too cheap for the times.

Seven of the above voting to cut Burtis off from the church, Winchester voting
to suspend and take his license, but not to cut off. It would be a singular
thing, indeed, if A. Burtis could make the people believe that the above
council made a mistake, and cut off the wrong man, and that seven councilors
out of nine should all be wrong, and Abraham Burtis right. But all who please
may rely on the testimony of the enemies' row.

And I will risk my cause upon the decision of the councils of Heaven, composed
of the Elders of Israel here on earth.

Here follows a certificate given me by the council, signed by the President
and Clerk, in the name of the council.

...

Now all I have to say is, can a man do more than to prove himself innocent,
any more than this I shall not attempt to do One thing more I wish to mention,
which is, that Burtis is trying to make the people believe that he had not the
privilege of introducing his testimony against me before the council; this is
a mistake, he was called upon a number of times, to bring forth his testimony,
and did not, but got angry and left the council, who was to blame for this?
was the council to run after the man and catch him, and bind him hand and
foot, and bring him into council and compel him to talk? This is the true
statement of the case as the minutes of the council will shew, which will
shortly appear in due form, with a statement of the whole affair. And I wish
it distinctly understood that A. Burtis and Charles Asson, are cut off, for
lying and slandering the authorities of the Church, (and that their testimony
is no longer received against the members of the Church, according to the laws
of the same.) And that all who have lied about me, may soon expect to share
the same fate.

If any believe their lying tales hereafter, it is because they have not the
love of the truth, but take pleasure in unrighteousness and believe a lie that
they might be damned.

When an enemy like Burtis and others commence a warfare upon me without any
cause or provocation they must expect I will make my defence and if I hear any
more of their lying tales, I will give them their character in full.

It has been reported that I have spoken disrepectfully of the Burtis
connections; this is a falsehood! I never had any acquaintance with them,
consequently never had any occasion to say anything against them, and as this
is only one out of the hubdred and ninety and nine lies, that Burtis has told,
I shall take no further notice of it.
