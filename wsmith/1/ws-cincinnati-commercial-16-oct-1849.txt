TO THE EDITOR OF THE CINCINNATI COMMERCIAL: Sir -- Many exaggerated reports have been circulated in favor of the Salt Lake City. This city contains a few mud houses, built up by a few runaways from justice. As to agricultural advantages, there is contiguous to the Salt Lake valley a barren chain of mountains, and an extensive desert. In the valley itself, a shower of rain is a circumstance of rare occurrence, and the only chance of riasing crops is by irrigating the land. This will be a good military post for the government, no doubt, and we would advise the government to watch the military tactics of the renegade Salt Lake Mormons. The valley may be a suitable place for horse thieves, bogus makers, murderers and outlaws, or they never would have taken up their abode in such a barren desert. We would not make these explanations if fanaticism of bigots and fools did not have a tendency to lead thousands of men, women and children, to destruction. Â  WM. SMITH.
