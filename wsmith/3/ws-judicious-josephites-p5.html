INASMUCH as all men are to be judged out of the books which are written,
according to their deeds, I deem it of importance to the Saints of the last
days, and to mankind in general, to keep a true record of their proceedings
and transactions in this life; therefore I propose to record a concise history
of my early life and proceedings; especially since the time I was baptized
into the church of God, and numbered with the Saints of the last days.

I was born in XXCITY XXSTATE, on the 13th day of XXMONTH, XXYEAR. At the age
of five, my father moved his family into the town of XXCITY, XXCOUNTY,
XXSTATE. We moved into XXCITY, in the same county in XXYEAR, where we were
engaged in agricultural pursuits, as we had been since my birth. While there
we cleared a large farm, built a house, planted an orchard, and had commenced
living in more comfortable circumstances.

During this period, I enjoyed in common with other boys of my age and
circumstances, but limited opportunities for acquiring an education; and being
like most youths, more fond of play than study, I made but little use of the
opportunities I did have. In XXYEAR and XXYEAR, the people in our neighborhood
were very much stirred up with regard to religious matters by the preaching of
a XXTITLEANDNAME, an Elder of the Methodist Church, and celebrated throughout
the country as a "..."

My mother, who was a very pious woman and much interested in the welfare of
her children, both here and hereafter, made use of every means which her
parental love could suggest, to get us engaged in seeking for our souls'
salvation, or (as the term then was) "..." She prevailed on us to attend the
meetings, and almost the whole family became interested in the matter, and
seekers after truth. I attended the meetings with the rest, but being quite
young and inconsiderate, did not take so much interest in the matter as the
older ones did. This extraordinary excitement prevailed not only in our
neighborhood but throughout the whole country. Great numbers were converted.
It extended from the Methodists to the Baptists, from them to the
Presbyterians; and so on until finally, almost all the sects became engaged in
it; and it became quite a fashion to "..." My mother continued her
importunities and exertions to interest us in the importance of seeking for
the salvation of our immortal souls, until almost all of the family became
either converted or seriously inclined.

After the excitement had subsided, in a measure, each sect began to beat up
for volunteers; each one saying, "..." "..." "..." etc. The consequence was
that my mother, my brothers XXFIRSTNAME and Samuel, older than I, joined the
Presbyterian Church. Joseph, then about seventeen years of age, had become
seriously inclined, though not "..." as the phrase was, began to reflect and
inquire, which of all these sects was right. Each one said that it was right;
which he knew could not be the case; and the question then was which one of
the whole taught the true gospel of XXJESUSCHRIST, and made known the plan of
salvation. If he went to one he was told they were right, and all others were
wrong. If to another, the same was heard from them. Each professed to be the
true church. This did not satisfy him, as he was aware that there could be but
one way of entering into the Kingdom of Heaven, and that there was but one
"..." etc. All this however was beneficial to him, as it urged him forward,
and strengthened him in the determination to know for himself of the certainty
and reality of pure and holy religion. He continued in secret to call upon the
Lord for a full manifestation of his will, the assurance that he was accepted
of him, and that he might have an understanding of the path of obedience.

At length he determined to call upon the Lord until he should get a
manifestation from him. He accordingly went out into the woods and falling
upon his knees called for a long time upon the Lord for wisdom and knowledge.
While engaged in prayer a light appeared in the heavens, and descended until
it rested upon the trees where he was. It appeared like fire. But to his great
astonishment, did not burn the trees. An angel then appeared to him and
conversed with him upon many things. He told him that none of the sects were
right; but that if he was faithful in keeping the commandments he should
receive, the true way should be made known to him; that his sins were
forgiven, etc. A more elaborate and accurate description of his vision,
however, will be found in his own history.

The next day I was at work in the field together with Joseph and my eldest
brother Alvin. Joseph looked pale and unwell, so that Alvin told him if he was
sick he need not work; he then went and sat down by the fence, when the angel
again appeared to him, and told him to call his father's house together and
communicate to them the visions he had received, which he had not yet told to
any one; and promised him that if he would do so, they would believe it. He
accordingly asked us to come to the house, as he had something to tell us.
After we were all gathered, he arose and told us how the angel appeared to
him; what he had told them as written above; and that the angel had also given
him a short account of the inhabitants who formerly resided upon this
continent, a full history of whom he said was engraved on some plates which
were hidden, and which the angel promised to show him. He continued talking to
us sometime. The whole family were melted to tears, and believed all he said.
Knowing that he was very young, that he had not enjoyed the advantages of a
common education; and knowing too, his whole character and disposition, they
were convinced that he was totally incapable of arising before his aged
parents, his brothers and sisters, and so solemnly giving utterance to
anything but the truth. All of us, therefore, believed him, and anxiously
awaited the result of his visit to the hill Cumorah, in search of the plates
containing the record of which the angel told him. He went, and upon his
return told us that in consequence of his not obeying strictly the
commandments which the angel had given him, he could not obtain the record
until four years from that time.

<p>
During this four years, I spent my time working on the farm, and in the
different amusements of the young men of my age in the vicinity. I was quite
wild and inconsiderate, paying no attention to religion of any kind, for which
I received frequent lectures from my mother and my brother Joseph. He occupied
himself part of the time working on the farm, and part of the time in XXSTATE
where he courted a young lady by the name of XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, whom he
afterwards married. At the end of the appointed time he went and obtained the
plates which were pointed out to him by the angel. The story being noised
abroad, he was pursued while on his way home with the plates, by two persons
who desired to obtain the possession of the plates to convert them into money.
However, he escaped to the house and brought the plates with him, wrapped up
in a tow frock. He could not permit us to see them, because he said the angel
told him not to do so, and he was determined to obey strictly this time; for
he had disobeyed before and was compelled to wait four years before he could
come into possession of the plates.
