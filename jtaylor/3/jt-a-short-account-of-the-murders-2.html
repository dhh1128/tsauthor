I have the affidavits concerning this affair now laying before me, and were it
not that it might swell this address to too great a length, I might here
transcribe them. When these companies got together, they possibly might appear
formidable to some. This was the time that our brethren called upon Esq. Black
for the purpose of reconciling difficulties, and coming to some terms, whereby
a permanent settlement might be made, and a recurrence of difficulties
avoided. They did not visit him in a large body as has been stated, but three
or four individuals waited on XXTITLEANDNAME. XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME was not
among the number, but being afterwards invited by XXTITLEANDNAME, he attended
upon his invitation. As much has been said relative to coercion having been
used by XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, and those that were with him, and that the
document which it was said he was forced to sign, was unconstitutional and
subversive of the rights of American citizens, etc, etc, I here insert a copy
of the instrument that XXTITLEANDNAME drew and signed with his own hand, as I
have the original in my possession I shall give it verbatim, not being
accountable either for its composition or orthography.

XXTITLEANDNAME afterwards made oath that he was forced to sign this document
by a number of armed men, but it was not so; when our people went, they told
him that their intention was to seek to establish peace, and the subsequent
investigation by Judge King and Gen. XXLASTNAME proved that no coercion was
intended, nor used by our people; and their dockets will establish that fact.
But the truth of the matter is, that XXTITLEANDNAME and others had sold their
pre-emption rights, corn, etc. to our people, and had obtained remuneration,
some in part, others for all their property; which however they said they
cared little about, as they would soon drive the Mormons, and possess their
properties again. This is a fact well known in XXCOUNTY, and XXTITLEANDNAME,
after riding through the county to stir up excitement and collect a mob,
treated his friends (the mob) with a payment of $XXNUMBER which he had received
from our brethren, stating that he had cheated the Mormons out of it, and
would soon possess his land again, etc. -- And the events which have
subsequently transpired evidently show that he has accomplished his design,
and that too from the support of the highest authorities of this state. Whilst
this mob were thus collected together, they commenced their depredations by
shooting at our men, taking arms and prisoners, driving off cattle, hogs, etc.

The militia were called upon to defend our brethren, and Gen. XXLASTNAME with a
company repaired to the place, and finally succeeded in dispersing the mob.
Meanwhile a number of our brethren who had located themselves and bought
property at XXCITY, on the banks of the Missiouri river, in XXCOUNTY, were
threatened with extermination by the mob, if they would not evacuate that
place and leave the county. Several messages of this kind were sent but no
attention was paid to them. An anonymous letter was then sent to a
XXTITLEANDNAME, a widow, in XXCITY, who did not belong to the church; as they
said they did not wish her destroyed in the general massacre that would
shortly come upon the Mormons. She showed this letter to some of the brethren,
who however disregarded it, as they had been taught from their infancy, that
they were the free born sons of liberty, citizens of the United States, a
country that has always boasted of an enlightened policy, a liberty of
conscience and of worship, impartial laws, and an equitable administration,
and they never yet had been inducted into the mysteries of mobocracy. At the
appointed time the mob came amounting to upwards of a hundred with the
XXTITLEANDNAME Woods, and Abbot Hancock, two Presbyterian Priests, at their
head in company with the sheriff. XXTITLEANDNAME had sworn out a writ against
XXTITLEANDNAME, stating that he was in danger of his life in consequence of
some expressions made by XXTITLEANDNAME. The sheriff apprised XXTITLEANDNAME
of this, who as soon as he was told that they had a civil process against him,
delivered himself up on condition that the sheriff would disperse the mob; he
agreed to do so, but the mob instead of dispersing, came into the village,
threatening the women and children, and stating that they would throw their
property into the XXSTATE river, etc.
