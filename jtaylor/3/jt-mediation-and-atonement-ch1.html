In the last chapter of St. Lukeâ€™s Gospel is to be found a deeply interesting
account of several events that took place on the day that the Redeemer was
resurrected. Amongst other incidents, he relates that on that day two of the
disciples took a melancholy journey from Jerusalem to the neighboring village
of Emmaus. Whilst they walked, the sadness of their hearts found expression on
their tongues, and they mournfully rehearsed to each other the story of the
crucifixion of their Master. By and by, they were joined by an apparent
stranger, who, though none other than the resurrected Savior, was not
recognized by them. In answer to His inquiries, they repeated the sad history
of the days just passed, and expressed the disappointment that His death had
brought, for they trusted that it had been He who should have redeemed Israel.
Then Jesus said unto them, "..."

One great and very striking statement is here made by the Lord himself, to the
effect that it behooved Christ to suffer, and the question at once presents
itself before us, why did it behoove Him? Or why was it necessary that He
should suffer? For it would seem from His language, through His sufferings,
death, atonement and resurrection, "..." could be preached among all nations,
and that consequently if He had not atoned for the sins of the world,
repentance and remission of sins could not have been preached to the nations.

A very important principle is here enunciated, one in which the interests of
the whole human family throughout all the world are involved. That principle
is the offering up of the Son of God, as a sacrifice, an atonement and a
propitiation for our sins. Jesus said, He came not to do His will, but the
will of His Father, who sent Him. He came, as we are told, to take away sin by
the sacrifice of Himself; and not only did He come, but He came in accordance
with certain preconceived ideas that had been entertained and testified of by
the Prophets and men of God in all preceding ages, or from the days of Adam to
the days of John the Baptist, the latter being His precursor or forerunner,
who indeed, when he saw Him coming, made the declaration, .... At His baptism
the Spirit of God bore witness to this testimony and descended upon Jesus in
the form of a dove, or, rather, the form of a dove was the sign of the Holy
Spirit; whilst a voice was heard from heaven proclaiming: "..."
