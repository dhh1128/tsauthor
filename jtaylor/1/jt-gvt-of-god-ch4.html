What Is Man? What Is His Destiny and Relationship to God?

Having shewn in the foregoing chapters, that the rule of God is perfect where
he governs alone, that the rule of man is imperfect, and has introduced
confusion and misery, and that the plans of men are not competent to restore
the world to happiness, and the fulfilment of the object for which it was
created; it now devolves upon us to investigate the way that this thing can,
and will be accomplished; for there is a time spoken of in the Scriptures,
when there will be a reign of righteousness.

First, then, we will enquire who and what is man? and what is his destiny, and
what his relationship to God? For before we can define government correctly,
it will be necessary to find out the nature of the being that has to be
governed.

What, then, is man? Is he a being temporal and earthly alone, and when he
dies, does he sink into forgetfulness? Is he annihilated? or has he a spirit
as well as a body? If the first be the case, he alone has a right to regulate
his own affairs, to frame his own government, and to pursue that course which
to him seems good; if not, the case is different. I do not here wish to enter
into a philosophical disquisition on the subject, but, as I am writing at
present to believers in the Bible, I shall confine myself more to that. I will
state, that man is an eternal being, composed of body and spirit: his spirit
existed before he came here; his body exists with the spirit in time, and
after death the spirit exists without the body. In the resurrection, both body
and spirit will finally be reunited; and it requires both body and spirit to
make a perfect man, whether in time, or eternity.

I know there are those who suppose that the spirit of man comes into existence
with his body, and that intelligence and spirit are organized with the body;
but we read, that when God made man, he made him of the dust of the earth; he
made him in his own likeness. Man was then a lifeless body; He afterwards
"..."

Before that spirit was given, he was dead, lifeless; and when that spirit is
taken away, he is again lifeless; and let not any one say that the body is
perfect without the spirit; for the moment the spirit leaves the body, no
matter how perfect its organization may be, the man is inanimate, and
destitute of intelligence and feeling: "..."
Hence we find that when Jarius's daughter was dead, his servant came and told
him, saying, "..." but when she was
restored, it is said "..." Luke
viii. 55. When her spirit was absent, the body was dead; when it returned, the
body lived. "..." Num xxvi 16 Again, the
Lord in speaking to Jeremiah, said, "..." i 5. I would ask, What part of Jeremiah did he know? It could not be
his body, for it was not in existence; but he knew his spirit, for "..." The Lord speaks to Job and says, "..." xxxviii 4, 6 Again, John says, "..." Rev xvii

This spirit proceeds forth from God, and is eternal; hence Solomon says, in
speaking of death, "..." Eccles. xii. 7. That the spirit is eternal, is
very evident, from the Scriptures; Jesus prayed to his father, and said, "..." John xvii 5 Here Jesus speaks of an existence
before he came here, of a glory he had with his Father before the world was.
Christ, then, existed before he came here and took a body. Again Jesus says,
"..." John xvii 6

Let us see what the Apostle Paul says on the subject: "..." Ephes i 3, 4 Christ, then, existed
with his Father before the world was, and the Saints existed in, or with him.
What part? their bodies? no, their spirits. Again, man exists after he leaves
here. It is unnecessary to say anything about the life of the spirit, after
the death of the body, or of the resurrection, as the subjects are so
generally known and believed. Paul says, "..." 1 Cor xv 19-21, 52-54

If man, then, is an eternal being, came from God, exists here for a short
time, and will return, it is necessary that he know something about God, and
his government. For he has to do with him not only in time, but in eternity,
and whatever man may be disposed to do, or however he may vaunt himself of his
own abilities, there are some things he has no control over. He came into the
world without his agency, he will have to leave it, whether he desires it or
not; and he will also have to appear in another world. He is destined, if he
improves his opportunities, to higher and greater blessings and glory than are
associated with this earth in its present state: and hence the necessity of
the guidance of a superior power, and intelligence, that he may not act the
part of a fool here, and jeopardize his eternal interests; but that his
intelligence may be commensurate with his position; that his actions here may
have a bearing upon his future destiny; that he may not sink into the slough
of iniquity and degradation, and contaminate himself with corruption; that he
may stand pure, virtuous, intelligent, and honourable, as a son of God, and
seek for, and be guided and governed by his Father's counsels. Having said so
much on this subject, we will continue our investigation still further, and
enquire next, What is our relationship to God? In answering this, I would
briefly remark, that the position that we stand in to him, is that of a son.
Adam is the father of our bodies, and God is the father of our spirits. I know
that some are in the habit of looking upon God, as a monster only to be
dreaded, known only in the earthquake, the tempest, the thunder, and the
storm, and that there is something gloomy and dismal attached to his service.
If there is, it is the appendage of man, and not of God. Is there anything
gloomy in the works that God has made? Turn where we will, we see harmony,
loveliness, cheerfulness, and beauty.

The blessings of providence were made for man, and his enjoyment; he is placed
as head of creation. For him the earth teems with the richest profusion; the
golden grain, the luscious fruit, the choicest vines; for him, the herbs, and
flowers, bedeck the earth, shed their odoriferous perfumes, and display their
gorgeous beauty; for him, the proud horse yields his back, the cow gives her
milk, and the bee its honey; for him, the sheep yields its fleece, the
cotton-tree its down, and the worm its silk. For him, the shrub and vine bloom
and blossom, and nature clothes herself in her richest attire; the rippling
stream, the pure fountain, the crystal river flow for him, all nature spreads
her richest charms, and invites him to partake of her joyousness, beauty, and
innocence, and to worship her God.

Talk about melancholy, in the fear of God, and in his service! It is the
corruption of the world, that has made men unhappy; and the corruption of
religion that has made it gloomy: these are the miseries entailed by men, not
the blessings of God. Talk about gloom! is there gloom in the warbling of the
birds, in the prancing of the horse, in the playfulness of the lamb, or kid;
in the beauty of flowers, in any of Nature's gifts, or rich attire, or in God,
that made them, or in his service?

There are others, again, who would place the Lord at an immense distance, and
render our approach to him almost impossible; but this is a superstitious
idea, for our Father listens to the cries of his children, numbers the hairs
of their heads; and the Scriptures say, "..." He speaks to his elect, and says, "..." Zech ii 8 He is our Father; and hence the
Scriptures tell us to pray, "..." Paul says, "..." Heb xii 9 We have, then, both a temporal and a spiritual Father; and
hence his solicitude for our welfare, and his desire for our happiness. Says
Jesus, "..."

What a delightful reflection for his servants, to draw nigh to their Father,
as to an endearing parent, and ask for blessings, as a son would ask for
bread, and be confident of receiving. Hence the faithful in the Apostles' days
received a spirit, whereby they could say, "..." or Father, Father.
What an endearing relationship! and if the world could comprehend, how gladly
would they throw themselves upon his guardianship, seek his wisdom and
government, and claim a father's benediction; but Satan has blinded the eyes
of the world, and they know not the things which make for their peace.
