I had put into my hands the other evening, when at the meeting, in the
Wellington Rooms, a small circular, purporting to be an "...", and wherein
the doctrins that I believe in and teach are called "..."
and "..." and, which, in the opinion of the author, Mr.
Heys, come very little short of "..." and that
I have been guilty of insulting the religious public of the town of Douglas,
with the abundance of sheer nonsense, which appears in the Book of Mormon, and
also in a periodical which is called the "..."

How far the religious public have been insulted and imposed upon by the
principles that I have advanced since my arrival in the town of Douglas, those
who have heard me will be the most correct judges, and not Mr. Heys.

He states, that the principles taught by me are "..." and
"..." but, he has not stated wherein they are damnable, or
heretical. I would just remark, that it is not the first time that I have been
charged with this since my arrival in Douglas. How far my former accuser, Mr.
Hamilton, proved his assertion, the public, who heard us, are the best judges.

Mr. Heys has said something about modern revelations saying what is "..."
Has he shewed us wherein? No. But we are left to guess it out, or to depend
upon his word for it.

We are referred, then, by Mr. Heys to a story, which he considers is well
authenticated, that has gone the round of the American newspapers; and which
infidels and religious bigots have hailed with delight, and chewed as a sweet
morsel; but which long ago has been exploded, and its propagators ashamed of
it.

What a pity it is, that men standing in the "..." which
Mr. H. says he does to the people, "..." should be
necessitated to have recourse to such flimsy productions as these instead of
the word of God. "..." says Paul. What by? Are we to prove
them by newspaper stories? No! "..." —Isaiah 8:20 I want nothing more
than the word of God to prove the truth or falsehood of any system. I say
again, what a pity it is that Mr. Heys cannot do that, and is necessitated to
have recourse to so poor a subterfuge, thus fulfilling that scripture which
says, "..." Isaiah 28:15

But Mr. H. states that his story is well authenticated; that it is given by
Mr. Smith’s father-in-law, whose undoubted veracity is attested by two
Associated Judges of the Court of Common pleas. All this, indeed, appears very
plausible—so it did that our Saviour was "..." Matt 28:15, for there
were most respectable witnesses to it. Who were they? The Pharisees, chief
priests, doctors, etc, etc. The holy and pious men of that generation, that
ought to have loved and supported truth, who gave the soldiers money to say
that his disciples stole him away, and said that "..." Matt 28:12-14.
