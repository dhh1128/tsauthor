<p>
After the waters of the flood had subsided, we are told, Noah and his family
came forth out of the ark:
</p>

<p>
The details of this act are given us somewhat differently in the inspired
translation: it is there written:
</p>

<p>
Thus, we discover that the first act after the destruction of the world by a
flood was a recognition of the great expiatory principle of the atonement,
which was to be made by the Only Begotten Son of God, as revealed by the angel
to Adam. And as God recognized Adam’s and Abel’s offerings, so He also
recognized that of Noah: and as a result, the Patriarch obtained great
promises, in which the people of all ages, then to come, would be interested.

We will now turn to Melchizedek, of whom it is written in King James’
translation:
</p>

<p>
This passage is given with greater completeness in the inspired translation,
where it appears as follows:
</p>

<p>
In this action of Melchizedek, in administering the bread and wine, by virtue
of his priestly office, is there not a representation of the body and the
blood of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, as also indicated by the Messiah

The principle of power also over the varied creations of God, above spoken of,
pertaining to the Holy Priesthood after the order of the Son of God, has, by
faith, been manifested to the world in the lives and actions of numbers of the
servants of the Most High. The power of Enoch, wherein he caused the earth to
tremble, whilst mountains fled at his command, and rivers were turned out of
their course, has already been referred to. By this power, exercised in mighty
faith, Melchizedek stopped the mouths of lions and quenched the violence of
fire; by it the waters of the Red Sea were divided by Moses, and the children
of Israel passed through dry shod; by it Elijah and Elisha smote the waters of
the Jordan and crossed on dry land; by it Daniel escaped the ferocity of the
lions, and the three Hebrew children were delivered from the fiery furnace.
