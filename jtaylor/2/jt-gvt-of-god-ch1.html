The Wisdom, Order, and Harmony of the Government of God.

The Kingdom of God is the government of God, on the earth, or in the heavens.
The earth, and all the planetary systems, are governed by the Lord; they are
upheld by his power, and are sustained, directed, and controlled by his will.
We are told, that "..."[A] XXSCRIP If
all things, visible and invisible, are made by and for him, he governs and
sustains all worlds to us known, together with the earth on which we live. If
he governs them, they are under his dominion, subject to his laws, and
controlled by his will and power.

[Footnote A: I wish here to be understood, that at present I am writing to
believers in the Bible. I may hereafter give my reasons for this faith; at the
present I refer to the Scriptures without this.]

If the planets move beautifully, and harmoniously in their several spheres,
that beauty and harmony are the result of the intelligence and wisdom that
exist in his mind. If on this earth we have day and night, summer and winter,
seed time and harvest, with the various changes of the seasons; this
regularity, beauty, order, and harmony, are the effects of the wisdom of God.

There are two kinds of rule on the earth; one with which man has nothing
directly to do, another in which he is intimately concerned. The first of
these applies to the works of God alone, and His government and control of
those works; the second, to the moral government, wherein man is made an
agent. There is a very striking difference between the two, and the comparison
is certainly not creditable to man; and however he may feel disposed to vaunt
himself of his intelligence, when he reflects he will feel like Job did when
he said, (xlii 6) "..."

In God's government there is perfect order, harmony, beauty, magnificence, and
grandeur; in the government of man, confusion, disorder, instability, misery,
discord, and death. In the first, the most consummate wisdom and power are
manifested; in the second, ignorance, imbecility, and weakness. The first
displays the comprehension, light, glory, beneficence, and intelligence of
God; the second, the folly, littleness, darkness, and incompetency of man. The
contemplation of the first elevates the mind, expands the capacity, produces
grateful reflections, and fills the mind with wonder, admiration, and
enlivening hopes; the contemplation of the second produces doubt, distrust,
and uncertainty, and fills the mind with gloomy apprehensions. In a word, the
one is the work of God, and the other that of man.

In order to present the subject in a clear light, I shall briefly point out
some of the leading features of the two governments.

The first, then, is that over which God has the sole control, such as the
heavens and the earth, for "..." It may be well here to say a few words on His moral government, in
the heavens. All we can learn of that is very imperfectly set forth in the
Scriptures. It would seem, however, that all was perfect order, for "..." "..." And in the creation of the fish, the fowls, the beasts,
the creeping things, and man, it was done in the councils of God. The word
was, Let us do this, and it was done. It would seem, then, that that
government is perfect in its operations, for all the mandates of God are
carried out with the greatest exactitude and perfection. God spake, chaos
heard, and the world was formed.

We find also that transgression is punished; when Satan rebelled he was cast
out of heaven, and with him those who sinned.

Here, then, in these things consummate wisdom was manifested, and power to
carry it out.

The plan of redemption was also made thousands of years ago. Jesus is spoken
of by the prophets as being "..." The future destiny of this earth is also spoken of by prophecy; the
binding of Satan; the destruction, and redemption of the world; its celestial
destiny; its becoming as a sea of glass; the descent of the new Jerusalem from
heaven; the destruction of iniquity by a power exercised in the heavens,
associated with one on the earth; and a time is spoken of where John
says--"..." XXSCRIP But I shall let this
pass for the present, and content myself with saying on this subject, that in
the councils of God, in the eternal world, all these things were understood:
for if He gave prophets wisdom to testify of these things, they obtained their
knowledge from Him, and He could not impart what He did not know; but "..." XXSCRIP 18 God,
then, has a moral government in the heavens, and it is the development of that
government that is manifested in the works of creation; as Paul says, "..."
XXSCRIP

But when we speak of the heavens, we mean also the planetary system; for the
world, and other worlds are governed by principles independent of man. The
power that causes this earth to roll on its axis, and regulates the planets in
their diurnal and annual motions, is beyond man's control. Their revolutions
and spheres are fixed by nature's God, and they are so beautifully arranged,
and nicely balanced, that an astronomer can calculate the return of a planet
scores of years beforehand, with the greatest precision and accuracy. And who
can contemplate, without admiration, those stupendous worlds, rolling through
the immensity of space at such an amazing velocity, moving regularly in their
given spheres without coming into collision, and reflect that they have done
so for thousands of years. Our earth has its day and night, summer and winter,
and seed time and harvest. Well may the poet say that they--

"..."

And here let me remark how different is this to the works of man. We see,
then, the power of God manifested in their preservation and guidance; but when
we reflect a little further, that while our planetary system rolls in perfect
order round the sun, there are other systems which perform their revolutions
round their suns; and the whole of these, our system with its centre, and
other systems with their centres, roll round another grand centre: and the
whole of those, and innumerable others, equally as great, stupendous, and
magnificent, roll round another more great, glorious, and resplendent, till
numbers, magnificence, and glory, drown the thought, we are led to exclaim
with the prophet, "..."
XXSCRIP Without referring again to the motions of our earth, and the
beautiful regularity and precision of the whole of this elegant machinery, we
will turn our attention a little to the works of creation as found on the
earth. The make, construction, and adaptation of each for its proper sphere,
are the work of God; and they are all controlled by His wisdom and power,
independent of man. In the conformation of the birds, the beasts, the fishes,
the reptiles, the grains, herbs, plants, and trees, we see a striking
exemplification of this fact. No matter which way we turn our attention, the
same order and intelligence are displayed. The fish in their organization are
peculiarly adapted to their proper element; the birds and beasts to theirs;
the amphibious animals to theirs. The nicely organized machinery of their
bodies; their bones, muscles, skins, feathers, scales, or hair; the formation
of their bodies, their manner of living, together with the nature of their
food, and their particular adaptation to the various elements and climates
which they occupy, are all so many marked evidences of skill, forethought,
intelligence and power. We will here notice a few examples. Plunge bird,
beast, or man, into the water, and let them remain there, and they will soon
die; take a fish out of the water, and death ensues; yet all are happy, and
move with perfect enjoyment in their proper spheres. Elevate a man, beast, or
fish, into the air, and let them fall, and they will be bruised to death; but
the bird, with its wings, light bones, and fragile body, is peculiarly adapted
to the aerial element in which it moves, and is perfectly at home; while the
brute creation and men feel as much so on the earth. Again, their habits,
food, coatings, or coverings, digestive powers, and the organization of their
systems, are all peculiarly adapted to their several situations. The same
principle is developed in their arrangement and position on the earth. Those
that inhabit a southern climate are peculiarly adapted to that situation;
while those that inhabit a northern are equally fitted for theirs.

Take the reindeer and polar bear to the torrid zone, and they would be out of
their proper latitude, and would probably die. Remove the elephant, lion, or
tiger, to Iceland or Greenland, and leave them to their own resources, and
they would inevitably perish.

We will notice for a moment the construction of their systems. Each one is
possessed with muscular strength, or agility, according to its position,
wants, or dangers, and there is a beauty, a symmetry, and a perfection about
all God's works, which baffle and defy human intelligence to copy. An artist
is considered talented if he can make, after years of toil, a striking
likeness of any of those things, either on canvas, or in marble. But when he
has done, it is only a dead outline; remove a little paint, or tear the
canvas, and its beauty is destroyed; break the arm of a statue, and we see
nothing but a mutilated stone. But take a man, for example, and remove the
skin, there is still order and beauty; remove the flesh, there is still
workmanship and skill, and the bones, the flesh, the muscles, the arteries and
veins, and the nerves, and the lungs, not to forget the exquisite fineness of
the sensitive organs, manifesting a skill, a forethought, a wisdom, and a
power, as much above that of man as the heavens are above the earth.

We see the power, wisdom, and government of God, displayed in the amazing
strength of some of the largest of the brute creation; as also in the fineness
and delicacy, of the arrangement of the smaller. And while we admire the
stupendous power of the elephant, we are equally struck with the fineness,
delicacy, and beauty of some of the smaller insects. The prescience, and
intelligence of God, are as much manifested in arranging the bones, muscles,
arteries, and digestive organs of the smallest animaculæ, as in the
construction of the horse, rhinoceros, elephant, or whale. I might touch upon
the organization of plants, herbs, trees, and fruits; their various
compositions, modes of nourishment, manner of propagating their kind, etc.; but
enough has already been said upon this subject. It is one that no one will
dispute upon; Jew and Gentile, black and white, Christian and Heathen,
philosopher and fool, all have one faith on this subject.

I have briefly touched upon it for the purpose of presenting in a clear light
the imbecility and weakness of man; for wherever we turn our attention, we see
power, wisdom, prescience, order, forethought, beauty, grandeur and
magnificence.

These are the works of God, and shew His skill, workmanship, glory, and
intelligence. They reflect His divine power, and shew in unmistakeable
characters the wisdom of his government, and the order that prevails in that
part of creation over which He has the sole and unlimited control.

We can perceive very clearly that what God has done, is rightly done. It is
not governed by instability and disorder, but continues from eternity to
eternity to bear the impress of Jehovah.
