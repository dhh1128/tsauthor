We next quote from the XXBOOKOFMORMON, making our selections in chronological
order; first from the Book of Ether, and afterwards from the records of the
Nephites. ... The reference, in the above quotation, to the serpent which
Moses raised up before the children of Israel in the wilderness, directly
confirms the statement of our Savior: ... We now return to our extracts from
the XXBOOKOFMORMON. King Benjamin teaches:

We now turn to the Book of Doctrine and Covenants:

From a discourse by President Brigham Young, August 8, 1852.

Having thus gathered in one numerous testimonies from the writings of the
ancient inspired servants of God who dwelt on either hemisphere, and joined
therewith extracts from the revelations of the present dispensation, with
regard to the foreordination, mission, life-work and death of the Only
Begotten Son, we shall now proceed to trace, from the sacred volumes, the
revelation of our Savior, and the prophecy of his advent from the earliest
ages of recorded history, until He fulfilled in Himself all, even all that, as
offering, sacrifice, sacrament, vision or prophetic word, had foreshadowed His
appearing, or typified the mystery of His all-atoning blood.

We shall commence this portion of our subject by showing that sacrifices have
been offered from the very earliest times, and that when performed under
divine instruction, they prefigured and typified the sacrifice of the Son of
God, and that it was with this view these sacrifices were offered up.

It is recorded in the fourth chapter of the XXSCRIP that, "..."

limited, and somewhat obscure, we will here refer, as a starting point on this
subject, to the account given of these events in the Pearl of Great Price,
which is a selection from the revelations, translations and narrations of
Joseph Smith, the Prophet, Seer and Revelator of XXCHURCHFULL. For in that translation it is stated that Adam, previous to
these acts of Abel and Cain, offered up a sacrifice by the direct command of
God. It is there written that the Lord gave unto Adam and Eve "..." We are
further informed that "..."

From the above it would seem that Adam, until instructed by the angel, did not
know the reasons for the offering up of sacrifices, nor the object that the
Lord had in view in requiring this offering at his hands; for, being asked by
the angel why he performed this rite, he said, "..." and the object of the
visit of this holy being to Adam evidently was to show him why he was called
to offer a sacrifice to the Lord, as, on Adam expressing his ignorance of the
intent of this offering, the angel stated very explicitly that this thing was

may hereafter explain why it was necessary that the sacrifice of the Son of
God should be made.
