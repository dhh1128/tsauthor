SIR─Having perused in your journal of last week a letter headed
"..." signed "..." in which my
principles are attacked, you will oblige me by inserting the following. The
writer commences by stating "..." I would remark that nothing can prove
more "..." to me, if the portrait be correctly drawn, and the
principles truly developed. As publicity is what I have been courting ever
since my arrival in Douglas, light and truth, "..."
are what I want  to have my principles tried by, and not by the creeds
and opinions of men. If XXTITLEANDNAME will do this fairly, he will only accelerate
the advancement of truth, which is already progressing with rapid strides. The
public have been apprised of my anxiety for this, for when the XXTITLEANDNAME
Heys, Wesleyan Minister of this town, published certain falsehoods, I
published a reply in pamphlet form, in which I challenged him to an
investigation and of those principles before the public, and stated that the
"..." should be the subject of discussion, and that the
doctrines contained in it should be tested by the Word of God. This reply,
through the favour of the proprietors, will be found in this week’s Liberal.
The prefaratory remarks of my latter antagonist I shall just touch upon. He
introduces the Koran as an example of the XXBOOKOFMORMON, and states that
there are in it "..."is exactly the character of the XXBOOKOFMORMON, which is put forth by the XXLDS as given by inspiration:
it is written apparently in imitation of the Scriptures where the historic is
combined with what is strictly doctrinal and didactic."..."If
they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in
them."..."mixed up with all
sorts of fictions."..."delusion"..."error,"..."never at any period
has pure religion been revived, or anything God-like made its appearance upon
the earth, but Satan has opposed it."..."Now when
we consider the unhealthy state of the professed Church, etc.;"..."UNHEALTHY, CORRUPT, and IGNORANT."..." That
never at any period has pure religion been revived, or anything God-like made
its appearance on the earth, but Satan has opposed it through the many
instruments under his control,"..." the god of this world"..."Now the Spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times
some shall depart from the faith;"..."Though we, or an Angel from heaven, preach
any other gospel to you than that which we have  preached unto you, let
him be accursed."..."contend earnestly for the faith that was once delivered to the saints,"..."these
men pretended to have received from an angel of God the XXBOOKOFMORMON."..."These men"..."angel of God."..."These men"..."angel of
God,"..."pretended"..."they wandered about in sheep-skins and
goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented."..."Evil be
to him that evil thinks." That men have wickedly and designedly altered the
writings of others I am fully prepared to show;─that XXTITLEANDNAME has introduced
into his pamphlet words which he cannot substantiate  is evident, and
perhaps I shall be able to point out other alterations before we get through.
Hanover-street, Oct. 13, 1840.
