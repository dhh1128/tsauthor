I had put into my hands the other evening, when at the meeting, in the
Wellington Rooms, a small circular, purporting to be an "...", and wherein the
doctrins that I believe in and teach are called "..."
</p>

<p>
and "..." and, which, in the opinion of the author, XXTITLEANDNAME, come very
little short of "..." and that I have been guilty of insulting the religious
public of the town of Douglas, with the abundance of sheer nonsense, which
appears in the XXBOOKOFMORMON, and also in a periodical which is called the
"..."
</p>

<p>
How far the religious public have been insulted and imposed upon by the
principles that I have advanced since my arrival in the town of Douglas, those
who have heard me will be the most correct judges, and not XXTITLEANDNAME.
</p>

<p>
He states, that the principles taught by me are "..." and "..." but, he has
not stated wherein they are damnable, or heretical. I would just remark, that
it is not the first time that I have been charged with this since my arrival
in Douglas. How far my former accuser, XXTITLEANDNAME, proved his assertion,
the public, who heard us, are the best judges.
</p>

<p>
XXTITLEANDNAME has said something about modern revelations saying what is
"..." Has he shewed us wherein? No. But we are left to guess it out, or to
depend upon his word for it.
</p>

<p>
We are referred, then, by XXTITLEANDNAME to a story, which he considers is
well authenticated, that has gone the round of the American newspapers; and
which infidels and religious bigots have hailed with delight, and chewed as a
sweet morsel; but which long ago has been exploded, and its propagators
ashamed of it.
</p>

<p>
What a pity it is, that men standing in the "..." which XXTITLEANDNAME says he
does to the people, "..." should be necessitated to have recourse to such
flimsy productions as these instead of the word of God. "..." says Paul. What
by? Are we to prove them by newspaper stories? No! "..." --XXSCRIP I want
nothing more than the word of God to prove the truth or falsehood of any
system. I say again, what a pity it is that XXTITLEANDNAME cannot do that, and
is necessitated to have recourse to so poor a subterfuge, thus fulfilling that
scripture which says, "..." XXSCRIP
</p>

<p>
But XXTITLEANDNAME states that his story is well authenticated; that it is
given by XXTITLEANDNAMEâ€™s father-in-law, whose undoubted veracity is
attested by two Associated XXSCRIP of the Court of Common pleas. All this,
indeed, appears very plausible--so it did that our Savior was "..." XXSCRIP,
for there were most respectable witnesses to it. Who were they? The Pharisees,
chief priests, doctors, etc, etc. The holy and pious men of that generation,
that ought to have loved and supported truth, who gave the soldiers money to
say that his disciples stole him away, and said that "..." XXSCRIP.
