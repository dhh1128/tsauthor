crossed over to this land and landed a little south of the Isthmus of Darien,
and improved the country according to the word of the Lord, as a branch of the
house of Israel, and then read such a goodly traditionary account, as the one
below, we can not but think the Lord has a hand in bringing to pass his
strange act, and proving the Book of Mormon true in the eyes of all the
people. The extract below, comes as near the real fact, as the four
