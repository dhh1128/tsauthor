The Book of Mormon speaks of ores, swords, cities, armies, &c.,
and we extract the following:-- ... In regard to there
being great wars, the following will shew [show]:- ...
If men, in their researches into the history of this
country, in noticing the mounds, fortifications, statues, architecture,
implements of war, of husbandry, and ornaments of silver, brass, &c.-were to
examine the Book of Mormon, their conjectures would be removed, and their
opinions altered; uncertainty and doubt would be changed into certainty and
facts; and they would find that those things that they are anxiously prying
into were matters of history, unfolded in that book. They would find their
conjectures were more than realized-that a great and a mighty people had
inhabited this continent-that the arts sciences and religion, had prevailed to
a very great extent, and that there was as great and mighty cities on this
continent as on the continent of Asia. Babylon, Ninevah, nor any of the ruins
of the Levant could boast of more perfect sculpture, better architectural
designs, and more imperishable ruins, than what are found on this continent.
Stephens and Catherwood's researches in Central America abundantly testify of
this thing. The stupendous ruins, the elegant sculpture, and the magnificence
of the ruins of Guatamala [Guatemala], and other cities, corroborate this
statement, and show that a great and mighty people-men of great minds, clear
intellect, bright genius, and comprehensive designs inhabited this continent.
Their ruins speak of their greatness; the Book of Mormon unfolds
their history.-ED.
