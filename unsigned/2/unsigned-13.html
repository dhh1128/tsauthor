The great change on the face of the earth in XXCITY has been wrought by the
industry of the saints. The wilderness has been made to blossom as the rose;
and where hazel-brush grew and mosquitos cousined, gardens
decorate, and the saints rest. We say ‘rest,’ because it is a luxury for
them to be let alone two or three years. But to our purpose, the country for
several miles around, is already risen into the great mass of a city, built by
the only people on the earth, that while they labor incessantly to make this
earth like the garden of the Lord, labor also, without purse or script, to
make men fit subjects for his kingdom and coming.

The city, we think, may now contain from one to two thousand houses, with a
population of 14 or 15000: and no matter what the enemy of true religion may
say, nor how many may choose to return to the beggarly elements of the world,
as in every age when Christ had a church upon the earth, and as, in every
place where the saints have been located for the time being, whatsoever they
have to do, in righteousness they have done with their might.

If this world would drop the scales from their eyes but once, and see what is
designed for the benefit and salvation of mankind, by the course the saints
are pursuing, we think that persecution would find less advocates, and honest
men more friends. Instead of falsehood, foolish reports, vague surmises, and
lies as empty as the space of air they occupy, we would see honest men, act
like the wise men of old, we have see the star in the east and have come to
worship the man child. Now ye great of the earth, without honest intention a
prophet and the sprit of God, who told those ‘wise men’ to go and worship
the babe in the manger? Would to God that, at least, a balance of this
generation would ‘go and do like wise.’
