A friend has handed us the following communication for insertion in the
Bostonian. We cheerfully comply with his request, not doubting that our
readers will also be gratified with the perusal of it. Joe. XXLASTNAME and his
followers are creating as great a revolution in the morals of our country, as
our fathers in 76 did in its political destinies. Our columns are open to both
sides of the question, provided communications are short and to the point. Mr
Editor, -- Having attended the lectures lately delivered at the Boylston Hall
by XXTITLEANDNAME, the Mormon lecturer of the city of XXSTATE, who has just
returned from England where he has been for the last fifteen months declaring
what he calls "..." I thought a short review of said lectures would prove
interesting to the readers of your valuable paper ; and I have no hesitation
in saying that Elder Nickerson has made a decided hit in getting
XXTITLEANDNAME to assist him at this time, as the large, intelligent, and
attentive congregations that have attended to hear his lectures fully prove.
His first lecture was delivered on Wednesday evening, XXMONTH 1st, in which he
gave his reasons for renouncing Methodism, and embracing the doctrines and
principles of the XXLDS. His reasoning was unanswerable, and the way he walked
into the affections of their supposed God, without body, parts, or passions,
was a caution to Yankee sinners. At the close he gave an opportunity for the
Methodists to defend their system, and although some of their preachers were
present, they said not a word -- for they well knew the bible condemned their
creed. On Thursday evening he fully showed the ignorance and folly of
Millerism, clearly proving by the scriptures that the Jews must be gathered
home from their long dispersion, and rebuild their city on its own heaps of
ruins, even Jerusalem itself, before Christ should come. On Friday and
Saturday evenings he introduced a talented young elder from XXCITY, named
Snow, who clearly set forth that the doctrine of Christ was, and is, the same
in all ages, and that the Church of Christ, when he has an organized church on
the earth, is composed of the same offices, the same ordinances, and has in it
the same gifts and blessings. On Sunday, XXTITLEANDNAME lectured on the second
coming of Christ, and gave much light on that subject, showing that it would
take place before this present generation shall pass away. He proved also, if
the bible is true, that the second advent must take place before XXYEAR. In
the course of the lecture he threw much light on the subject of the "..."
showing him not to be the Lord XXJESUSCHRIST, nor God the Father, but that he
is old father Adam, who shall sit as a great patriarch at the head of the
whole family, when the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, the Son of Man shall
come with the clouds, and come to the Ancient of Days, and the Saints should
take the kingdom, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven,
according to XXSCRIP. He also declared, as it was in the days of XXPROPHET, so
now God had called a prophet, viz XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, to warn this
generation to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man, and labored to show
the injustice of destroying any generation without first warning them. In the
afternoon he spoke on the subject of the resurrection, and every one that
heard him, that said any thing upon the subject, acknowledged that it
surpassed every thing they ever heard on the final destiny of man. He first
showed that the living soul is in its full meaning composed of two eternal
principles -- matter and spirit; that through disobedience man became a dying
soul. He then clearly set forth that Christ became the first fruits of them
that slept at his resurrection, or the first saved soul, or the type or
pattern of every soul that will be saved ; and that the soul consisted of the
spirit and body being re-united at the resurrection, no more to be separated ;
and that the soul thus raised would be composed of flesh, bones, and spirit,
but not blood. He then fully established the reign of Christ on earth one
thousand years, with those that have part in the first resurrection, and gave
much light on the full sway after the unbinding of Satan at the close of the
reign of peace; and then spoke of the last struggle between the powers of
darkness and of light, when death itself shall be conquered and immortality
alone endure. When he came to dwell on the second resurrection, the new
heavens and the new earth, the whole congregation seemed for a moment to
forget that they were listening to a poor despised Latter-day Saint or Mormon,
and tears of joy fell from their eyes in abundance, that plainly indicated
they were wrapped up in the subject before them, lie then sweetly spoke of the
bringing back of the tree of life, that caused many hearts to rejoice. In the
evening he preached on the re organization of the Church of Christ and the
marriage supper of the Lamb, showing that the Church of Christ had been
disorganized and driven in the wilder ness, and the priesthood or authority by
which men act in the name of XXJESUSCHRIST had been caught up unto the throne
of God, until the dispensation of the fulness of times should be ushered in by
the ministry of angels in fulfilment of many prophecies of the scriptures, lie
then set forth the scarlet coloured beast and her daughters, who compose the
present sectarian world, lie also showed that every sect on earth at the
present time received their priesthood or authority through the Church of Rome
or nowhere, for they all deny a later revelation than eighteen hundred years
ago. He then appealed to the people, declaring that the XXLDS were the only
people on earth that believed in revelations in this age, and that they were
the only society on earth that were contending for the faith once delivered to
the saints -- and that the sects of the present time plainly told the people
that the gifts of God could not be enjoyed, "..." He then declared that God
had, in fulfilment of his word, re organized the church with all the offices,
ordinances, gifts, and blessings, according to the New Testament pattern ;
that the bride, the Lamb's wife, that is the church, should make herself ready
to enter in at the marriage supper of the Lamb. At the close a gentleman arose
and told XXTITLEANDNAME that if he would work a miracle he would believe and
be baptized, for all the servants that God ever sent worked miracles to
convince the people. XXTITLEANDNAME then arose and said he thought God had
sent many prophets that did not work miracles, and named XXPROPHET and about a
dozen others; he then showed that Christ said a wicked and an adulterous
generation seek after a sign -- that the devil was the first sign-seeker in
the days of Christ. He then held up the bible and said, if the gentleman would
show him one place in the New Testament that a servant of God ever gave a sign
to make a man believe, he would do the same sign forthwith -- this the
gentleman failed to do, and so the matter ended. In conclusion, I must say,
that notwithstanding I am no Mormon, yet as far as I have heard them, they
preach the truth. A Lover of Truth

Mr Editor, -- You will doubtless recollect that some two or three weeks ago I
gave you a short sketch of the lectures delivered by Elder XXINITIAL
XXLASTNAME, at the Boylston Hall, and also promised if he produced anything
worthy of notice in his forthcoming lectures, that you should hear from me
again. The reason of my so long delaying to notice this subject, is not that
there was nothing worthy of notice in the lectures; but about the time I
should have written, XXTITLEANDNAME and his society were charged with
blasphemy, lying, fraud, treason, and murder: and I thought if they were
guilty of these heavy charges, they were unworthy of anything but the halter
and hang man ; however, since that time XXTITLEANDNAME has nobly met the man
that made the heavy charges above named, and entirely freed himself and the
society to which he belongs, of every vestige of said charges; and the
opposers of the Mormons, are left in shame, confusion, and disgrace, and
"...", as XXLASTNAME calls it, is the great exciting subject in XXCITY at the
present time; and truly it can be said, they that turn the world upside down
have come hither also, and the general cry among sectarians is, "..." Before I
enter upon a short description of the lectures, I wish to notice one important
item in the discussion lately held in the Marlboro' Chapel; it is relative to
the bible being the rule or standard of evidence in their decisions on points
of doctrine and principle. On the last evening but one of the discussion, to
save time and come directly to the point it was moved by XXTITLEANDNAME, (who
is a Free Enquirer) that the disputants, XXTITLEANDNAME, and elder XXLASTNAME
take the bible as the standard of evidence. To this proposition XXLASTNAME,
the Mormons, and the Free Enquirers agreed, but XXTITLEANDNAME and his
sectarian friends would not agree to it, and being most in number they voted
down the proposition; yes, those very men that are continually crying "..."
</p>

<p>
actually voted against the bible ; yes, voted it down for no other reason that
the writer knows, only that it condemns them and their creeds. From the moment
that vote was taken, I have been a determined opposer of sectarianism and
priest craft in all its monstrous and soul-killing forms, but a friend to the
bible, and bible religion. The three lectures that I alluded to in my previous
communication were on the subject of the XXBOOKOFMORMON, the building of Zion,
and the pouring out of the vials of the wrath of God, in the last days. On the
subject of the XXBOOKOFMORMON his arguments were clear and conclusive, plainly
proving by many prophecies in the bible that such a record must come forth
before God could gather the Jews from their long dispersion. He particularly
dwelt on the 29th chap, of XXPROPHET and the latter part of the 37th chap, of
XXPROPHET, commencing with the 15th verse. He then clearly proved the
XXBOOKOFMORMON to be the stick, record, or history of the descendants of
Joseph that dwelt in this land (America), separate from their brethren, in
fulfilment of the predictions of Jacob and XXPROPHET, see XXSCRIP, also part
of XXSCRIP ; also XXSCRIP. He argued from the above and many other passages of
scripture, that the descendants of Joseph were to be come, "..." and "..." --
"..." He introduced an account of many American antiquities together with the
discoveries lately made by XXTITLEANDNAME, that all go to prove that the
American Indians were once an enlightened people and understood the arts and
sciences, as the ruined cities and monuments lately discovered fully prove. He
then declared that this record had not come forth in the place of the bible,
but in fulfilment of the bible ; that its coming forth clearly demonstrated
that Jesus has been as good as his word, viz : he told his disciples he had
other sheep that were not of that fold (in Jerusalem) and they also should
hear his voice, for he was sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, --
and some of the lost sheep of the house of Israel, viz : -- of the tribe of
Joseph, being in America, it was necessary Jesus should visit them, as also
the ten tribes in the "..." He declared that Jesus did visit both the above
named branches of the house of Israel during the forty days before his final
ascension from the Mount of Olives,* and that the XXBOOKOFMORMON was not only
a history of the dealings of God with the descendants of Joseph on this
continent, previous to the crucifixion of our Lord, but also an account of the
gospel as established among them by the personal appearance of Christ on this
continent ; and that the account of the gospel in the XXBOOKOFMORMON agreed
with the account in the bible, thereby proving that the gospel of Christ is
the same in every nation, composed of the same eternal truths, the same gifts,
the same offices, the same ordinances, and every thing the same as when Christ
has an organised church on the earth ; and that the XXBOOKOFMORMON had come
forth as an "..." containing an account of the gospel in much plain ness,
being translated by the gift and power of God by the use of the Urim and
Thummim, that had come forth with the plates that contain the record. He also
stated that the plates, containing the record, had been hid up unto the Lord
by XXPROPHET the son of Mormon, the last prophet among the descendants of
Joseph on this continent; that about the time this event took place, they had
fallen into sin, and great wickedness ; many of their cities had been
overthrown by earthquakes, and they left to fall in ignorance and unbelief,
until the "..." and that now their record had come forth, throwing a flood of
light on the early history of this continent, and would yet be hailed by every
lover of truth as one of the most glorious events of the nineteenth century.
