1. EVIDENCES IN PROOF OF THE XXBOOKOFMORMON.
</p>

<p>
We have laying before us, a neat little work of 256 pages, 32 mo. entitled
"..." etc. By XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, minister of the gospel; published at
XXCITY XXSTATE We are much pleased with the spirit manifested by the writer,
and feel to commend him in his laudable undertaking.
</p>

<p>
We make the following extracts, commencing on the 97th page.
</p>

<p>
I will next introduce the description of some of these ancient fortifications
and military works of defense, as recorded in the American
Antiquities, by XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, and also introduce a history of the
building of these fortifications and works of defense [defense], as recorded
in the XXBOOKOFMORMON; and I will here remark, that the XXBOOKOFMORMON was
published in A. D. XXYEAR, and the American Antiquities, by XXFIRSTNAME
Priest, was not published until A. D. XXYEAR, three years after. Antiquities,

<p>
The foregoing is but a few of the corresponding accounts of fortifications and
works of defense [defense] there are to be found in the XXBOOKOFMORMON and
American Antiquities, but these are sufficient to show to the public that the
people whose history is contained in the XXBOOKOFMORMON, are the authors of
these works.-But again; as we trace the history of this people down through
succeeding generations, we find that one Gadianton, a robber, rose up and
organized a band to rob and plunder. These robbers prepared strong holds and
secret places in the mountains, to which they could flee, and be secure when
the armies of the Nephites pursued them. Some of these strong holds and secret
places were discovered in XXYEAR--two years after the XXBOOKOFMORMON was
published-by a XXTITLEANDNAME, and communicated to the editor of the Christian
Advocate and Journal. This account is recorded on page 169 of the American
Antiquities. XXTITLEANDNAME describes this discovery as follows:
</p>

<p>
"..."
</p>

<p>
XXTITLEANDNAME thinks them to have been constructed during some dreadful war,
and those who constructed them, to have acted on the defensive; and believes
that twenty men could have withstood the whole army of Xerxes, as it was
impossible for more than one to pass at a time, and might by the slightest
push, be hurled at least an hundred and fifty feet down the rocks.
</p>

<p>
XXBOOKOFMORMON, page 479, 2nd Ed., "..." Again; XXBOOKOFMORMON, page 481,
"..." Again; XXBOOKOFMORMON, page 485, 2nd Ed., "..." And on the 487 and 488
pages, we are informed how these robbers were finally destroyed; it was by a
stratagem. A part of the Nephite armies getting between the robbers and their
secret places and strong holds, by which they were cut off in their retreat.
</p>

<p>
This again, is evidence that the XXBOOKOFMORMON is true, and that this band of
robbers were the constructors of this strong hold and these secret rooms which
XXTITLEANDNAME has described; for mark! this discovery was not made untill
[until] two years after the XXBOOKOFMORMON was published, consequently the
writer of the XXBOOKOFMORMON could not have written this tale concerning the
robbers, to account for the construction of those caverns, for it was not
known that there was such a place in existence, until after the book was
written and published. And thus we have abundance of proof from recent
discoveries, American Antiquities and prophecy, that the history contained in
the XXBOOKOFMORMON is true.
</p>

<p>
Again; this history informs us that about four hundred years after Christ,
this nation of Nephites were brought down and destroyed by the Lamanites; and
this because they became proud and lifted up, practising [practicing] all
manner of wickedness and abominations, and they refused to repent and turn
again unto God; therefore because they were more wicked than the Lamanites,
God stirred up the Lamanites to camp against them round about, and to raise
forts against them with a mount, and thus they were brought down. But just
before their final overthrow, a man by the names of Mormon took their record
containing their history and sacred writings, from the time they left
Jerusalem, (the city where David dwelt,) unto his days, and made an
abridgement [abridgment] therefrom, and engraved it upon plates which he made
out of ore. These plates, after Mormon's death, fell into the hands of
XXPROPHET, his son, who survived the entire destruction of the Nephites,
finished the record, and deposited it in a stone box in the earth, that it
might not be destroyed; to come forth in due time for a sign to Israel, that
the time of their redemption had come. And also, in connection with the Bible,
to be set up as an ensign for the nations; and thus, this nation of Nephites
possessing the light of God's revelation, which constituted them Ariel, or
Lion of God, and being "..." (that is, having come out from Jerusalem,) was
brought down and their words having been written and hid up in the earth and
come forth again out of the earth, they "..."
</p>

<p>
This account also agrees with the Indian traditions which I have quoted in a
former part of this work. It says, that their forefathers were once in
possession of a sacred Book, which was handed down from generation to
generation, and at last hid in the earth; but these oracles are to be restored
to them again and then they shall triumph over their enemies and regain their
ancient country.
</p>

<p>
But again, when this Book was taken from the place of its deposite [deposit],
the words thereof were delivered to the learned XXTITLEANDNAME of XXSTATE,
with a request that he should read them, but he could not; thus fulfilling the
11th verse of the 29th chapter of XXPROPHET, which says, the words of a book
which is sealed men deliver to one that is learned, saying, read this I pray
thee; and he saith I cannot for it is sealed. And the book is delivered to him
that is not learned, saying read this I pray thee; and he saith I am not
learned. Wherefore the Lord said, forasmuch as this people, (the people of
this generation,) draw near me with their mouths, and with their lips do honor
me; but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear towards me is
taught by the psecepts [precepts] of men; therefore behold, I will proceed to
do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for
the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, aud [and] the understanding of
their prudent men shall be hid. And this he has done-
</p>

<p>
First; by inspiring the unlearned XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, and giving him
wisdom and power from on high, with the means which were before prepared, to
read and translate the XXBOOKOFMORMON, the words of which the learned
XXTITLEANDNAME could not read; thus the wisdom of the wise has perished and
the understanding of the prudent is hid.
</p>

<p>
Secondly.-By raising up and inspiring illiterate and unlearned men, and
sending them forth with the XXBOOKOFMORMON in connection with the Bible, as an
ensign for the nations, to preach the fulness [fullness] of the gospel, and to
build up the kingdom of God on the earth, in direct opposition to all the
jarring systems of modern sectarianism, and giving them knowledge and wisdom
from on high, insomuch [inasmuch] that they have been enabled to confound,
astonish and bring to shame, confusion, and disgrace, every wise and learned
man who has dared to oppose them by fair arguments or candid investigation.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly.-It is a marvel and a wonder to this generation that this work has
spread so rapidly under the following circumstances: First, the men who were
engaged in preaching this doctrine were men of no influence, being the poor,
illiterate, and despised ones of the earth. Second,-they had not the
advantages of education which the most of the preachers of the different
denominations have. Third,-the advantages of that mighty engine, the press,
which all the Christian world are so highly blessed with, they were almost
wholly destitute of, while at the same time its power was put in requisition
against them in all parts of the land. It is true, they undertook, and did
publish a monthly periodical at diferent [different] times and places, but its
circulation was very limited, and their office, press and type have been three
times entirly [entirely] destroyed by mobs and incendiaries. Fourth,-they had
to sustain the shock of an overwhelming religious influence opposed to them by
the combined powers of every sect in America-they had to contend with the
prejudices of the ignorant and the pen of the learned, together with all the
lying slanders and misrepresentations which the devil and all his emissaries
on earth could invent; while at the same time the combined powers of earth and
hell were hurling a storm of persecution unparalelld [unparalleled] in the
history of the world. They were insulted by mobs, their houses torn down or
burned, their goods destroyed and fields of grain laid waste, some of them
were cast into dungeons and there kept for months loaded with chains. Yea
more-some of them were shot; others had their brains dashed out; others were
whipped to death; others were cut in pieces with swords knives, corn-cutters,
etc., while the whole society, at one time amounting to about 12 000 souls,
were banished from the State of XXSTATE and driven two hundred miles from
their lands, houses, homes and property, in the winter season, and this by the
order of the Executive of XXSTATE, one of the free and independent states of
this boasted republic. And the blood of many of these people now stains the
soil of XXSTATE because of their religious principles, in this their native
land; the land of boasted liberty and equal rights, whose officers, both of
the state and nation, have been deaf to the voice of innocence, imploring at
their feet for justice and protection in the enjoyment of their rights as
American citizens. And no doubt many of the instruments of these diabolical
proceedings verily thought they were doing God service, being inspired by the
press and pulpit, and encouraged by the officers of state; or what is still
worse, by the personal example of both officers of state and professed
preachers of the gospel, who were actually the leaders and abettors of all the
above horrible deeds. But under all these conflicting circumstances, this work
has spread and has penetrated every state in the Union from Maine to XXSTATE
as well as the Canadies [Canada's?]. It has reacheed [reached] the islands of
the sea-it has spread nearly all over England, and is now preached in Ireland,
Scotland and Wales-all this in the short space of ten years. Churches are
organized and conferences are held in all these regions, and the number of
disciples who have already embraced this work is from an hundred to an hundred
and twenty thousand. What but the arm of the Omnipotent could have moved it
forward thus! Under the conflicting circumstances referred to above, surely it
is a marvelous work and a wonder, causing the wisdom of the wise to perish and
the understanding of the prudent to be hid. But again, another feature about
this work which constitutes it marvelous and wonderful among the people of
this generation is, these preachers profess no authority from antiquity to
administer the gospel ordinances, but say that an angel has come down from the
midst of heaven, and conferred on them the priesthood and authority to preach
and administer the everlasting gospel unto them that dwell on the earth, and
to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, sayiug [saying] with a
loud voice, fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgement
[judgment] is come: and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and
the fountains of waters. (See XXSCRIP.) And they profess to be apostles,
prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers, all inspired by the Holy Ghost,
just like the ancient officers of the church and kingdom of God-(See XXSCRIP.)
Also the believers in this XXBOOKOFMORMON, being baptized for the remission of
sins and receiving the laying on of hands by these apostles and prophets, they
speak with new tongues and prophesy, cast out devils, and sometimes lay hands
on the sick and they recover, and thus one has given him by the Holy Ghost the
word of wisdom, and another the word of knowledge, and another faith, and
another the gifts of healing, and another the working of miracles, and another
prophecy, and another the diserning [discerning] of spirits, and another
divers kinds of tongues, and another the interpretation of tongues-just as was
anciently given to the church of Christ. (See XXSCRIP.) And in consequence of
these gifts the blind are made to see, the deaf to hear, the meek increase and
their joy is in the Lord, and the poor rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
Also, they that erred in spirit come to understanding, and they that murmured
learn doctrine. All these things are marvelous to this generation because
their fear towards God is taught by the precepts of men, and they know nothing
of inspiration or the power of God, therefore they have a form of godliness
but deny the power thereof. From such says Paul turn away. (See XXSCRIP.)
