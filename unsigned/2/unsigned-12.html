<p>
If there is any subject in which the saints of the Most High are interested
more than another, it is in the completion of the edifice; destitute of a
place of worship, and so many thousands subject to the inconvenience of
worshipping out of doors where the cold, heat, and damp alternately prey upon
the systems of the weak and delicate, and subject them to colds, fevers, and a
variety of diseases, renders it imperative upon us to use our energies in
building that house. This however is tolerable, when we consider the
inconveniences that we have to labor under in the winter season; when instead
of having a commodious building to worship in, we are subjected to the
inconvenience of worshipping in private houses, or in the best manner that we
can, and no matter how important a subject has to be laid before the saints,
it is imposible [impossible] for them to hear it, as there is no place for
them to congregate in.
</p>

<p>
These, as natural reasons, might be considered sufficient to induce any
religious community to use their utmost exertions in the accomplishment of so
desirable object. But when we consider the great work in which we are engaged,
a work that has been looked forward to with delight by the ancient servants of
God; a theme about which all the inspired poets have sung, and all the
prophets, from the foundation of the world, have wrote-even the "..." God has
reserved us as the honored instruments to participate in the blessings
glories, and privileges, that "..."
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances, blessed with the light and intelligence of heaven,
and with direct revelation from the Most High, it behooves us as his people to
use the most untiring diligence, and to exert all our energies in the
accomplishment of an object so desirable for us to attend to; and so pregnant
with importance to the inhabitants of this city. The Lord has given us
directions in regard to this affair, and has said, "..." This is a commandment
which is binding, which is imperative upon all God's people, and if we
consider ourselves his people, we shall feel ourselves bound under the
strongest obligations, even that of duty, to our God to fulfil [fulfill] this
requisition. We take pleasure in stating that many of the saints have come
forward with willingness and cheerfulness, and have tithed and consecrated
all, yea more than could have been required of them; whilst others have
relaxed in their duty and have been slow to perform their covenants. We know
that of late we have had gloomy times; clouds have been gathering around our
horizon, and our atmosphere has been impregnated with the foul effluvia of
wanton and unmerited persecution; the life of our prophet has been sought
after, and many unpleasant circumstances have transpired which in their nature
have had a tendency to damp the energies, and slacken the exertions of the
saints in the accomplishment of this great work; and as the building of the
Temple is principally depending upon the tenth day's labor of the inhabitants
of this place, when many are slack, as has been the ease of late, it has a
great tendency to retard the work-to dispirit those who are actively engaged,
and who feel zealous in the work, and to derange very materially the plans and
designs of the committee. There are some few things that devolve upon us to
mention, which, though an unpleasant work, we feel the importance of the cause
requires at our hands.
</p>

<p>
The committee find themselves very much perplexed in consequence of the
brethren not coming forward as usual from their different wards, to perform
their tenth of labor. They state that they cannot get sufficient stone
quarried to supply the stone cutters at the Temple, and that some of them have
been obliged to quit work in consequence, and that unless strenuous exertions
are immediately made, and the brethren come up promptly to their duty, the
work will be greatly retarded, and perhaps have to stop; at all events the
stone cutters will have to stop unless they get an immediate supply of stone.
Brethren, such things ought not to be: "..." We have commenced a good work we
have been zealously engaged in it-we have spent a great deal of labor, and
toil, and our expectations have been great when we have reflected upon the
blessings that would flow to us through that medium. Let us begin this next
week and continue our labors "..." The committee state that if they have a
sufficiency of stone quarried, they can not only be progressing with the work
this fall, but the stone cutters can be employed all the winter, and thus have
a great quantity of hewn stone ready to commence with as soon as the spring
opens which will greatly facilitate the progress of the work.
</p>

<p>
It may here be necessary to give a word or two of instruction: many of the
brethren no doubt out of the best of motives bring guns and watches, and other
kinds of property that is not saleable, or easy to dispose of; they give them
in at what is considered a fair valuation, yet they are not saleable-they will
not purchase either provisions or clothing for those that need, neither will
they purchase labor, and they lay as useless lumber the hands of the
committee. It is the especial desire of the committee, and absolutely
necessary for the prosperity of the work that the brethren in town pay their
tenth in labor, and not in property.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the brethren in the country, we would also say a word. Cattle
which are neither fit for milking or killing are frequently brought in for
tithing, and they lay as dead property on the hands of the committee-as they
have no way of feeding them they are put into the drove, from which several
have wandered off and been lost; we would therefore advise the brethren to
bring in fat cattle which would immediately supply the hands with beef; or
otherwise milch [milk] cows that might be disposed of to advantage. Another
word on this subject and we have done. Many of the brethren, in their
liberality bring in pumpkins, squashes, potatoes, and other vegetables, if,
when they were doing this they could bring a little corn meal, flour, butter,
pork, or other articles of that kind they would be very acceptable.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps we have said enough on this subject, but we feel the importance of it
and therefore speak plainly. It is for you, brethren, to say whether the work
shall stand or progress; one thing is certain, that unless that is done all
our efforts to aggrandize or enrich ourselves will be vain and futile. We may
build splendid houses but we shall not inhabit them; we may cultivate farms
but we shall not enjoy them; we may plant orchards, or vineyards, but we shall
not eat the fruit of them. The word of the Lord is build my house, and until
that command is fulfilled we stand responsible to the great Jehovah for the
fulfilment [fulfillment] of it, and if not done in due time we may have to
share the same fate that we have heretofore done in XXSTATE.
</p>

<p>
But leaving duty and interest out of the question, if we wish to receive great
blessings from the hands of Jehovah, if we wish to receive our anointing, if
we wish the glory of the priesthood to be more fully developed, if we wish to
do the will of God and to secure the blessings of the most high God, in fact
if we wish to secure our present, our temporal and eternal salvation, we shall
build that house.
