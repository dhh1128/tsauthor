From Stephen's "..."

"..."

The foregoing extract has been made to assist the XXLDS, in
establishing the XXBOOKOFMORMON as a revelation from God. It affords great joy
to have the world assist us to so much proof, that even the most credulous
cannot doubt. We are sorry that we could not afford the expense to give the
necessary cuts referred to in the original.

Let us turn our subject, however, to the XXBOOKOFMORMON, where these wonderful
ruins of Palenque are among the mighty works of the Nephites:-and the mystery
is solved.

On the 72d page of the third and fourth edition of the XXBOOKOFMORMON it reads
as follows: "..." And on page 280-1 is full
description of the Isthmus.

XXTITLEANDNAME' great developments of antiquities are made bare to the eyes of
all the people by reading the history of the Nephites in the XXBOOKOFMORMON.
They lived about the narrow neck of land, which now embraces Central America,
with all the cities that can be found. Read the destruction of cities at the
crucifixion of Christ, pages 459-60. Who could have dreamed that twelve years
would have developed such incontrovertible testimony to the XXBOOKOFMORMON?
surely the Lord worketh and none can hinder.
