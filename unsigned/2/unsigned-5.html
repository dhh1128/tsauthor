5. THE GOVERNMENT OF GOD.

The government of the Almighty, has always been very dissimilar to the
government of men; whether we refer to his religious government, or to the
government of nations. The government of God has always tended to promote
peace, unity, harmony, strength and happiness; while that of man has been
productive of confusion, disorder, weakness and misery. The greatest acts of
the mighty men have been to depopulate nations, and to overthrow kingdoms; and
whilst they have exalted themselves and become glorious, it has been at the
expense of the lives of the innocent-the blood of the oppressed-the moans of
the widow, and the tears of the orphan. Egypt, Babylon, Greece, Persia,
Carthage, Rome-each were raised to dignity amid the clash of arms, and the din
of war; and whilst their triumphant leaders led forth their victorious armies
to glory and victory, their ears were saluted with the groans of the dying,
and the misery and distress of the human family;--before them the earth was a
paradise, and behind them a desolate wilderness; their kingdoms were founded
in carnage and bloodshed, and sustained by oppression, tyranny, and despotism.
The designs of God, on the other hand, have been to promote the universal
good, of the universal world;-to establish peace and good will among men;-to
promote the principles of eternal truth;-to bring about a state of things that
shall unite man to his fellow man-cause the world to "..."-make the nations of the
earth dwell in peace; and to bring about the millenial [millennial] glory-when
"..."

The great and wise of ancient days have failed in all their attempts to
promote eternal power, peace, and happiness. Their nations have crumbled to
pieces; their thrones have been cast down in their turn; and their cities, and
their mightiest works of art, have been annihilated; or their dilapidated
towers, or time worn monuments have left us but feeble traits of their former
magnificence, and ancient grandeur. They proclaim as with a voice of thunder,
those imperishable truths-that man's strength is weakness, his wisdom is
folly, his glory is his shame.

Monarchical, aristocratic, and republican forms of government, of their
various kinds and grades, have in their turn been raised to dignity and
prostrated in the dust. The plans of the greatest politicians, the wisest
senators, and most profound statesmen have been exploded; and the proceedings
of the greatest chieftains, the bravest generals, and the wisest kings have
fallen to the ground. Nation has succeeded nation, and we have inherited
nothing but their folly. History records their puerile plans, their short
lived glory, their feeble intellect, and their ignoble deeds.

Have we increased in knowledge or intelligence? where is there a man that can
step forth and alter the destiny of nations, and promote the happiness of the
world? Or where is there a kingdom or nation, that can promote the universal
happiness of its own subjects, or even their general well being? Our nation,
which possesses greater resources than any other, is rent from center to
circumference, with party strife, political intrigue, and sectional interest;
our counsellors [counselors] are panic struck, our legislators are astonished,
and our senators are confounded; our merchants are paralized [paralyzed], our
tradesmen are disheartened, our mechanics out of employ, our farmers
distressed, and our poor crying for bread. Our banks are broken, our credit
ruined, and our states overwhelmed in debt;-yet we are, and have been in
peace.-What is the matter? Are we alone in this thing? Verily, no. With all
our evils we are better situated than any other nation. Let Egypt, Turkey,
Spain, France, Italy, Portugal, Germany, England, China, or any other nation
speak, and tell the tale of their trouble-their perplexity, and distress, and
we should find that their cup was full, and that they were preparing to drink
the dregs of sorrow. England, that boasts of her literature, her science,
commerce, etc., has her hands reeking with the blood of the innocent, abroad;
and she is saluted with the cries of the oppressed, at home.-Chartism,
O'Connelism, and Radicalism are gnawing her vitals at home; and Ireland,
Scotland, Canada, and the East, are threatening her destruction abroad. France
is rent to the core-intrigue, treachery, and treason lurk in the dark; and
murder, and assassination stalk forth at noon-day. Turkey, once the glory of
European nations, has been shorn of her strength-has dwindled into her dotage,
and has been obliged to ask her allies to propose to her tributary terms of
peace: and Russia, and Egypt are each of [t]hem opening their jaws to devour
her. Spain has been the theatre [theater] of bloodshed, of misery and woe, for
years past. Syria is now convulsed with war and bloodshed. The great and
powerful empire of China, which has for centuries resisted the attacks of
barbarians, has become tributary to a foreign foe; her batteries thrown down;
many of her cities destroyed, and her villages deserted. We might mention the
Eastern rajahs; the miseries and oppressions of the Irish; the convulsed state
of Central America; the situation of Texas and Mexico; the state of Greece,
Switzerland, and Poland-nay, the world itself presents one great theatre
[theater] of misery, woe, and "..." All, all
speak with a voice of thunder, that man is not able to govern himself-to
legislate for himself-to protect himself-to promote his own good, nor the good
of the world.

It has been the design of Jehovah, from the commencement of the world, and is
his purpose now, to regulate the affairs of the world in his own time; to
stand as head of the universe, and take the reigns of government into his own
hand. When that is done judgment will be administered in righteousness;
anarchy and confusion will be destroyed, and "..."
It is for want of this great governing principle that all this confusion has
existed; "..." this we have
fully shewn [shown].

If there was any thing great or good in the world it came from God. The
construction of the first vessel was given to Noah, by revelation. The design
of the ark was given by God, "..." The learning of
the Egyptians, and their knowledge of astronomy was no doubt taught them by
Abraham and Joseph, as their records testify, who received it from the Lord.
The art of working in brass, silver, gold, and precious stones, was taught by
revelation, in the wilderness. The architectural designs of the Temple at
Jerusalem, together with its ornament and beauty was given of God. Wisdom to
govern the house of Israel was given to Solomon, and to the judges of Israel;
and if he had always been their king, and they subject to his mandate, and
obedient of his laws, they would still have been a great and mighty people;
the rulers of the universe-and the wonder of the world. If Nebuchadnezzar, or
Darius, or Cyrus, or any other king possessed knowledge or power it was from
the same source, as the scriptures abundantly testify. If then, God puts up
one, and sets down another, at his pleasure-and made instruments of kings,
unknown to themselves, to fulfill his prophesies, how much more was he able,
if man would have been subject to his mandate, to regulate the affairs of this
world, and promote peace and happiness among the human family.

The Lord has at various times commenced this kind of government, and tendered
his services vo [to] the human family. He selected Enoch, whom he directed,
and gave his law unto, and to the people who were with him; and when the world
in general would not obey the commands of God, he translated Enoch and his
church, and the priesthood or government of heaven, was taken away.

Abraham was guided in all his family affairs by the Lord; was told where to
go, and when to stop; was conversed with by angels, and by the Lord; and
prospered exceedingly in all that he put his hand unto; it was because he and
his family obeyed the counsel of the Lord.-When Egypt was under the
superintendence of Joseph, it prospered, because he was taught of God; when
they oppressed the Israelites destruction came upon them. When the children of
Israel were chosen with Moses at their head, they were to be a peculiar
people, among whom God should place his name: their motto was "..." While in this state they might truly say, "..." Their government was a theocracy; they had God to make their
laws, and men chosen by him to administer them; he was their God, and they
were his people. Moses received the word of the Lord from God himself; he was
the mouth of God to Aaron, and Aaron taught the people in both civil and
ecclesiastical affairs; they were both one; there was no distinction; so will
it be when the purposes of God shall be accomplished; when "..." and "..." "..."

This is the only thing that can bring about the "..."- "..." Other attempts to promote universal peace and happiness in the human
family have proven abortive; every effort has failed; every plan and design
has fallen to the ground; it needs the wisdom of God, the intelligence of God,
and the power of God to accomplish this. The world has had a fair trial for
six thousand years; the Lord will try the seventh thousand himself; "..." iniquity will hide its hoary head, Satan will be bound, and
the works of darkness destroyed; righteousness will be put to the line, and
judgment to the plummet, and "..." To bring about this state of things there must of necessity be
great confusion among the nations of the earth; "..."-Am I asked what is the cause of the present distress? I would
answer: "..." The
earth is groaning under corruption, oppression, tyranny, and bloodshed; and
God is coming out of his hiding place, as he said that he would do, to vex the
nations of the earth. Daniel, in his vision, saw convulsion upon convulsion;
he "..." It is for us to be righteous
that we may be wise and understand, for "..." As a church, and a people it behoves [behooves]
us to be wise, and to seek to know the will of God, and then be willing to do
it; for "..." says
the scriptures. "..." says our Savior, "..." If Enoch, Abraham, Moses, the children of
Israel, and all God's people were saved by keeping the commandments of God,
we, if saved at all, shall be saved upon the same principle. As God governed
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, as families, and the children of Israel as a nation,
so we, as a church, must be under his guidance if we are prospered, proserved
[preserved], and sustained. Our only confidence can be in God; our only wisdom
obtained from him; and he alone must be our protector and safeguard,
spiritually and temporally, or we fall.

We have been chastened by the hand of God heretofore for not obeying his
commands, although we never violated any human law, or transgressed any human
precept: yet we have treated lightly his commands, and departed from his
ordinances, and the Lord has chastened us sore, and we have felt his arm, and
kissed the rod: let us we [be?] wise in time to come, and ever remember that
"..." The
Lord has told us to build the temple, and the Nauvoo House, and that command
is as binding upon us as any other; and that man who engages not in these
things is as much a transgressor as though he broke any other command-he is
not a doer of God's will, nor a fulfiller of his laws.

In regard to the building up of Zion it has to be done by the counsel of
Jehovah; by the revelations of heaven, and we should feel to say "..." We would say to the saints that come
here, we have laid the foundation for the gathering of God's people to this
place, and expect that when the saints do come they will be under the counsel
of those that God has appointed. The Twelve are set apart to counsel the
saints pertaining to this matter: and we expect that those who come here will
send before them their wise men according to revelation; or if not
practicable, be subject to the counsel that God has given or they cannot
receive an inheritance among the saints, or be considered as God's people; and
they will be dealt with as transgressors of the laws of God; we are trying
here to gird up our loins, and purge from our midst the workers of iniquity;
and we hope that when our brethren arrive from abroad, they will assist us to
roll forth this good work, and to accomplish this great design; that "..." that as
God's people, under his direction, and obedient to his law, we may grow up in
righteousness, and truth; that when his purposes shall be accomplished, we may
receive an inheritance among those that are sanctified.-ED.
