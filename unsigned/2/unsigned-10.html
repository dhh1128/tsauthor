Since our Extract was published from XXTITLEANDNAME' 'Incidents of Travel,'
etc., we have found another important fact relating to the truth of the
XXBOOKOFMORMON. Central America, or Guatimala, is situated north of the
Isthmus of Darien and once embraced several hundred miles of territory from
north to south.-The city of Zarahemla, burnt at the crucifixion of the Savior,
and rebuilt afterwards, stood upon this land as will be seen from the
following words in the book of XXPROPHET:-"..." [See XXBOOKOFMORMON 3d
edition, page 280-81.] It is certainly a good thing for the excellency and
veracity, of the divine authenticity of the XXBOOKOFMORMON, that the ruins of
Zarahemla have been found where the Nephites left them: and that a large stone
with engravings upon it as Mosiah said; and a "..." as XXTITLEANDNAME has
published, is also among the left remembrances of the, (to him,) lost and
unknown. We are not going to declare positively that the ruins of Quirigua are
those of Zarahemla, but when the land and the stones, and the books tell the
story so plain, we are of opinion, that it would require more proof than the
Jews could bring to prove the disciples stole the body of Jesus from the tomb,
to prove that the ruins of the city in question, are not one of those referred
to in the XXBOOKOFMORMON. It may seem hard for unbelievers in the mighty works
of God, to give credit to such a miraculous preservation of the remains,
ruins, records and reminiscences of a branch of the house of Israel: but the
elements are eternal, and intelligence is eternal, and God is eternal, so that
the very hairs of our heads are all numbered. It may be said of man he was and
is, and is not; and of his works the same, but the Lord was and is, and is to
come and his works never end; and he will bring every thing into judgment
whether it be good, or whether it be evil; yea, every secret thing, and they
shall be revealed upon the house tops. It will not be a bad plan to compare
XXTITLEANDNAME' ruined cities with those in the XXBOOKOFMORMON: light cleaves
to light, and facts are supported by facts. The truth injures no one, and so
we make another EXTRACT From Stephens' "..."
