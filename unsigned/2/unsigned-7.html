Three numbers more closes this volume, and as the distance to many of our
subscribers, requires three or four weeks for the papers to reach them, we
take the time in advance to stir up their minds by way of remembrance, that
our terms are in advance, and to continue the paper in as respectable a
standing as it is entitled to by the church it represents, we solicit a
continuance of the subscribers, and an extra effort by elders and agents for
new subscribers; and request those in arrears to remit the balance due
immediately; as well as to invite all that wish the fourth volume, which we
mean to make worthy the patronage of all well wishers to the great cause of
Jesus Christ, to send us the amount of their subscriptions before the
commencement of said volume on the 1st of Nov. next.
