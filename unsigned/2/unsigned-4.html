4. Traits of the Mosaic History, Found Among the Aztaeca Nations.
</p>

<p>
The tradition commences with an account of the deluge, as they had preserved
it in books made from the buffalo and deer skin, in which account there is
more certainty than if it had been preserved by mere oral tradition, handed
down from father to son.
</p>

<p>
They begin by painting, or as we would say by telling us that XXPROPHET, whom
they call Tezpi, saved himself with his wife, whom they call Xochiquetzal, on
a raft or canoe. Is not this the ark? The raft or canoe rested on or at the
foot of a mountain, which they call Colhuacan. Is not this Ararat? The men
born after this deluge were born dumb. Is not this the confusion of language
at Babel? A dove from the top of a tree distributes languages to
them in the form of an olive leaf. Is not this the dove of XXPROPHET, which
returned with that leaf in her mouth, as related in XXSCRIP? They say that on
this raft, besides Tezpi and his wife, were several children, and animals,
with grain, the preservation of which was of importance to mankind. Is not
this in almost exact accordance with what was saved in the ark with XXPROPHET,
as stated in XXSCRIP?
</p>

<p>
When the Great Spirit, Tezcatlipoca, ordered the waters to withdraw, Tezpi
sent out from his raft a vulture, which never returned, on account of the
great quantities of dead carcasses which it found to feed upon.. Is not this
the raven of XXPROPHET, which did not return when it was sent out the second
time, for the very reason here assigned by the Mexicans? Tezpi sent other
birds one of which was the humming bird; this bird alone returned, holding in
its beak a branch covered with leaves. Is not this the dove?-Tezpi, seeing
that fresh verdure now clothed the earth, quitted his raft near the mountain
of Colhuacan. Is not this an allusion to Ararat of Asia? They say the tongues
which the dove gave to mankind, were infinitely varied; which when received,
they immediately dispersed.-But among them were 15 heads or chiefs of
families, which were permitted to speak the same language, and these were the
Taltecs, the Aculhucans and Azteca nations who embodied themselves together,
which was very natural, and traveled they knew not where, but at length
arrived in the country of Aztalan, of the lake country of America. The plates
or engraving presented here is a surprising representation of the deluge of
XXPROPHET; and of the confusion of the ancient language at the building of the
tower of Babel, as related in the XXSCRIP. (see XXSCRIP.
</p>

<p>
We have derived the subject of this plate from Baron Humbolt's volume of
Researches in Mexico, who found it painted on a manuscript book, made of the
leaves of some kind of tree, suitable for the purpose, after the manner of
ancient nations of the sultry parts of Asia around the Mediterranean.
</p>

<p>
The plate, however here presented shows no more than a picture of the flood,
with XXPROPHET afloat on a raft, or as the traditions of some of the nations
say on a tree, a canoe, and some say in a vessel of huge dimensions. It also
shows by the group of men approaching the bird, a somewhat obscure
history of the confusion of the ancient language at the building of Babel, by
representing them as being born dumb, who receive the gift of speech from a
dove, which flutters in the branches of the tree, while she presents the
languages to the mute throng, by bestowing upon each individual a leaf of the
tree, which is shown in the form of small commas suspended from its beak.
</p>

<p>
Among the different nations, according to Humboldt, who inhabited Mexico, were
found paintings which represented the deluge, or flood of Tezpi.
</p>

<p>
The painting of which the plate is the representation, shows Tezpi, of
XXPROPHET, in the midst of the waters laying on his back. The mountain, the
summit of which is crowned by a tree and rises above the wasters is the peak
of Colhucan, the Ararat of the Mexicans. At the foot of the mountain on each
side appear the heads of XXPROPHET and his wife. The woman is known by the two
points extending up from her forehead, which is the universal designation of
the female sex among the Mexicans.; The horn at the left hand of the tree with
a human hand pointing to it, is the character representing a mountain and the
head of a bird placed above the head of Tezpi or XXPROPHET, shows the vulture
which the Mexicans say Tezpi sent out of his acalli or boat to see if the
waters had subsided.
</p>

<p>
In the figure of the bid with the leaves of a tree in his beak, is shown the
circumstance of the dove's return to the ark, when it had been sent out the
second time bringing a branch of the olive in its mouth; but in their
tradition it had become misplaced, and is made the author of the languages.
That birds have a language was believed by the nations of the old world. Some
of those nations retain a surprising traditional account of the deluge; who
say that XXPROPHET embarked in a spacious acalli or boat, with his wife, his
children, several animals, and grain, the preservation of which was of g eat
importance to mankind. When the Great Spirit, Tezcatlipoca, ordered the waters
to withdraw, Tezpi or XXPROPHET sent out from his boat a vulture. But the
bird's natural food was that of dead carcasses, it did not return
on account of the great number of dead carcasses with which the earth now
dried in some places abounded.
</p>

<p>
Tezpi sent out other birds one of which was humming bird; this bird alone
returned again to the boat, holding in his beak a branch covered with leaves.
Tezpi now knowing that the earth was dry, being clothed with fresh verdure,
quitted his bark near the mountain Colhucan or Ararat. A tradition of the same
fact, the deluge, is also found among the Indians of the Northwest. I
received, says a late traveler, the following account from a Chief
of one of the tribes in his own words, in the English. "..."
</p>

<p>
There are many things contained in the above that go to support the testimony
of the XXBOOKOFMORMON, as well as that of the Mosaic history. The Mexican
records agree so well with the word of the book of XXPROPHET (found by the
people of Limhi, which is contained in the XXBOOKOFMORMON) in relation to the
confounding of languages, that we insert the following:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Here, then, we have two records found upon this continent, that go to support
the words of eternal truth-the Bible; and whilst these records, both of them,
sanction the testimony of the scriptures in regard to the flood, the tower of
Babel, ands the confusion of languages; the tradition and hieroglyphics
of the Zaltees, the Colhuacans, and the Azteca nations, in
regard to the confusion of languages and their travels to this land, is so
like that contained in the XXBOOKOFMORMON, that the striking analogy must be
seen by every superficial observer.
</p>

<p>
In regard to the confusion of languages it is said of the above nations, that
there were "..." The XXBOOKOFMORMON, concerning the same event, says:
"..."-and it further states that Jared's brother's language was not
confounded; and they then prayed for their families and friends also, and the
Lord heard them in their behalf; and their language was not confounded. These
accounts, then, precisely agree, one of which was found in XXCOUNTY, XXSTATE,
and the other in Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Again, those nations, of families, embodied themselves together and traveled
they know not where, but at length arrived in the country of Aztalan, of the
lake country of America. The XXBOOKOFMORMON says, that the brother of Jared
cried unto the Lord, that he would give them another land; the Lord heard him,
and told him to go to a certain place, "..." This it further speaks is the
land of America. The coincidence is so striking that further comment is
unnecessary.-ED.
