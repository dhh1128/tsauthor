Jan. 3, 1837: President Z. Coltrin ordained me a member of the first Seventy
and pronounced great blessings upon my head by the Spirit of prophecy and
revelation. Some of them I will mention which are as follows. That my enemies
may confine me in prisons and chains and that I would rend the prisons and
chains in twain in the name of Jesus Christ and that the Lord would give me
great power, knowledge, and wisdom and faith so that I should heal the sick,
cause the blind to see, the lame to leap as an hart, the deaf to hear, stop
the mouths of lions and raise dead to life and waft myself (as did Philip)
from river to river, from sea to sea and from continent to continent for the
purpose of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ and that I should stand before
kings and princes and that they would send for me to receive wisdom, knowledge
and instruction at my mouth because they considered me wiser than themselves,
in like manner as the Egyptians sought wisdom at the hand of Joseph. And that
God would give me a multiplicity of blessings that I should preach to the
nations of the earth and to the inhabitants upon the islands of the sea and
that I should then return to stand upon Mount Zion in the flesh even in
Jackson County, Missouri, at the coming of Christ and that I should be caught
up to meet him in the clouds of heaven for he said this was the word of God
unto me and also that I should visit Kolob and preach to the Spirits in prison
and that I should bring all of my friends or relatives forth from the
Terrestrial Kingdom (who had died) by the power of the Gospel. These and many
other blessings were pronounced upon my head, and further said that I should
be annointed and my life sealed unto me and that there would be still greater
blessings pronounced upon my head.
