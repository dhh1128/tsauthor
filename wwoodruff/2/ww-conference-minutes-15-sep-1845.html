I have not presented the full minutes of these conferences, but have
endeavored to give the remarks in a brief manner. I rejoice to find these
conferences we visited so well united and prosperous in the principles of the
Gospel. XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME and XXLASTNAME will take their departure
together, for XXSTATE or XXCITY, about the 16th of XXMONTH. Though their
missions to England have been limited to about ten months, yet it has been
interesting to themselves and of much benefit to the Saints. Although we shall
feel the loss of these dear brethren, and miss their society, yet, as duty
calls them home, we feel to bid them God speed to the bosom of their families,
homes and friends, and the City of Joseph, with all the prayers, blessings,
and the good wishes to rest upon their heads, from the many Saints with whom
they have formed an acquaintance in this land.
