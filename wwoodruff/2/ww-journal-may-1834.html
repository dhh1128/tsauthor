While on Zion's Camp, we visited many of the mounds which were flung up by the
ancient inhabitants of this continent, probably by the Nephites and Lamanites.
We visited one of these mounds and several of the brethren dug into it and
took from it the bones of a man. Brother Joseph had a vision respecting the
person; he said he was a white Lamanite. The curse was taken from him or at
least in part. He was killed in battle with an arrow--the arrow was found
among his ribs. One of his thigh bones was broken; this was done by a stone
flung from a sling in battle years before his death. His name was Zelph. Some
of his bones were brought into the camp and the thigh bone which was broken
was put into my wagon and I carried it to Missouri. Zelph was a large thick
set man and a man of God. He was a warrior under the great prophet Onandagus
that was known from the Hill Cumorah or east sea to the Rocky Mountains. The
above knowledge Joseph received in a vision.
