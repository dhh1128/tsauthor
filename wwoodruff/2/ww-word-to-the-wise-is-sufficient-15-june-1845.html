When God commanded XXPROPHET to build an ark, he saved himself with his family
by gathering into it. When the angels commanded Lot to flee to Zoar, he saved
himself by fleeing thence. When Jesus commanded the Saints in Jerusalem to
flee to the mountains of Judea when they saw it beginning to be surrounded by
the Roman Army, their safety was in going there. And as the Lord has said by
the ancient prophets, that in the last days there should be deliverance in
Jerusalem and in Mount Zion; and by the mouth of the modern prophet, seer, and
revelator, pointed out the location of Zion, and commanded the Saints among
the Gentiles to gather thereunto and build it up, while the Jews gather to
Jerusalem. The safety of the Saints depends as much upon their fulfilling his
commandments, as the safety of XXPROPHET and Lot depended upon their obedience
to the commands of God in their day and generation; and my worst fears
concerning this matter are, that while the Saints scattered abroad among the
Gentile nations are waiting for better times, that they may accumulate more
wealth and means to assist them in keeping the commandments of God, that the
storm will burst over their heads in an hour they think not of, and find them
no better prepared than at the present time, for the Spirit whispers to me
that there is more danger of being too slow than too fast.

Let the Saints at least learn the day of their visitation, and know the things
that belong to their peace, before their path is blocked up with more
difficulties than they find strewed in it at the present time.

And as the churches have been fully organized in the eastern cities of the
United States, XXCITY, XXSTATE, XXCITY, and many other places, the Saints that
feel disposed to emigrate that way, could get employ, and still be at home
with the Saints, and I would recommend them to do so as far as a door is open
for them, and this is according to the Council of the Presidency in XXCITY.
