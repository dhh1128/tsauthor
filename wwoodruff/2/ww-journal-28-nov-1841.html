XXMONTH 28, XXYEAR: Sunday I spent the day at XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME's in
company with Joseph and the Twelve in conversing upon a variety of subjects.
It was an interesting day. Elder Joseph Fielding was present; he had been in
England four years. We also saw a number of English brethren. Joseph said the
XXBOOKOFMORMON was the most correct of any book on earth and the keystone of
our religion and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than
any other book.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 30, XXYEAR: I spent some time with Joseph and the Twelve. Joseph says
XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME must live with Bro. XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME and if they
receive them kindly and patiently, it shall prove a great blessing, unto them.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 5, XXYEAR: In the evening we walked to Bro. Joseph's and spent several
hours at his house on a visit and had a pleasant stay with him and Sister
XXFIRSTNAME. Bro. Joseph had commenced this day to proofread the
XXBOOKOFMORMON that it might be sterotyped. He read 60 pages. He rehearsed
over the XXSTATE transactions, spoke of the death of XXFIRSTNAME W. Patten and
the request which he made of him in his last dying moments. Joseph will grant
it if God will.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 7, XXYEAR: I spent most of my time in the store but in the evening I
attended meeting and heard a discourse delivered by Lyman Wight who declared
some most stirring truths concerning the building of the Temple and the XXCITY
House. If the Saints did not do it, they would be rejected as a church with
their dead, saith the Lord. We should again be driven, too. He spoke in truth
and the spirit of God.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 25, XXYEAR: Christmas Day was an interesting day indeed. The Twelve
were invited to a Christmas supper at XXTITLEANDNAME XXLASTNAME's. It was
excellent sleighing and I got a horse and sleigh and carried the wives of the
Twelve to XXTITLEANDNAME's and home again. After our meeting broke up, our
company consisted of XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, XXINITIAL
XXLASTNAME, XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME, and XXINITIAL
XXLASTNAME. All with our wives except XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME who waited upon
XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME. We had an excellent feast and before we left,
XXTITLEANDNAME made each one of the Twelve a present of a lot of land and made
out a bond for a deed of the whole Quorum, each lot worth $50, making $600 in
all. My lot was No. 4, Block 12 in XXLASTNAME second addition to XXCITY, a
warrantee deed to be given on or before the 5th day of XXMONTH A.D. XXYEAR.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 27, XXYEAR: The Twelve or a part of them spent the day with Joseph the
Seer and he unfolded unto them many glorious things of the kingdom of God, the
privileges and blessings of the priesthood, etc. I had the privilege of seeing
for the first time in my day the Urim and Thummim.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 16, XXYEAR: ... in the evening I married XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME and
XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 8, XXYEAR: A revelation was given a few days since for the Twelve to
obtain the printing establishment of XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME and govern the
printing of the Times and Seasons and all the Church publications as they are
directed by my Holy Spirit in the midst of their councils saith the Lord.
After consulting upon the subject the quorum appointed Elders XXINITIAL
XXLASTNAME and XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME of the Twelve to edit the Times and
Seasons and take charge of the whole establishment under the direction of
Joseph the Seer. Accordingly, I left my station at the XXCITY Provision Store
and commenced this day to labor for the Church in the printing establishment.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 4, XXYEAR: I spent the day with Bro. XXLASTNAME in finishing the
invoice of the printing establishment, books and stationary, and in the
evening we again met at Joseph's store and XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME made out the
deed to XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME of his lot and house containing the printing
establishment and all appurtenances belonging thereto, amounting in all to
$6,600.
</p>

of the day a law was passed regulating marriage. Joseph the Seer made many
interesting remarks concerning our privileges. Council adjourned to next day
evening.

resurrection, "..."

<p>
May 15, XXYEAR: Sunday, True information has just reached us that the noted
Governor XXLASTNAME of XXSTATE who by his orders expelled ten thousand
XXLDS, has just been assassinated in his own house and fallen in his own
blood. Three balls were shot through his head, two through his brains and one
through his mouth, tongue and throat. Thus this ungodly wretch has fallen in
the midst of his iniquity and the vengeance of God has overtaken him at last,
and he has met his just deserts though by an unknown hand. This information is
proclaimed through all the papers and by dispatched messengers and hand bills
through the land. XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME hath died as a fool dieth and gone to
his place to receive the reward of his works.
</p>

<p>
May 27, XXYEAR: The First Presidency, The Twelve and High Council and virtuous
part of the Church are making an exhortation a lot these days to cleanse the
Church from adulterers, fornicators and evil persons for there are such
persons crept into our midst. The high council have held a number of meetings
of late and their researches have disclosed much iniquity and a number have
been cut off from the Church. I met with the High Council today on the trial
of XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, XXPROPHET XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME and XXFIRSTNAME
XXLASTNAME. The two former were cut off for adultery and the case of XXINITIAL
XXLASTNAME was put off til tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
XXMONTH 18, XXYEAR: Also Joseph commanded the Twelve to organize the Church
more according to the Law of God, that is to require of those that come in to
be settled according to their council and also to appoint a committee to wait
upon all who arrive and make them welcome and counsel them what to do.
XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME, and
XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME were the committee appointed to wait upon emigrants and
settle them.
