Beloved Friends, I deem it my duty to address a few lines to you through the
medium of the Star, before I take my departure from England on my return to
America. The shortness of my time, and the multiplicity of business, forces me
to be brief.

You have already been informed, that the persecution and banishment of the
Saints west of the Rocky Mountains, and a desire to deliver my own family and
friends is the sole cause of my sudden departure from your midst. And I now
once more appeal unto you, that you will let your prayers ascend up before
God, day and night, in behalf of your afflicted brethren in Zion, that the
Lord may deliver them from persecution and oppression, which they have long
groaned under. Though an edict of banishment is passed, and they are about to
make a sacrifice of their houses and lands, etc, etc, and endure the fatigues
of a journey of near two thousand miles, still our persecutors are not
satisfied with this, but are striving to stir up every wicked and ungodly
character to malign us, and charge all their own black deeds of infamy and
crime upon the Saints, in order that the world, far and near, may really think
they are doing God service while thus persecuting the Saints. But, the day
will come when all men will get their reward for the deeds done in the body. I
hope and trust that the Saints--the Saints throughout the land--will not be
weary in well-doing, but sustain the general cause of Zion by prayer, love,
charity, faith, and all good works. My stay in your midst, in this mission has
been limited to one year, but I rejoice much at the progress and prosperity of
the cause during this period.

It has been a year of much interest to the church in Britain as well as in
America, and I trust that the same interest may continue and increase until
the house of Israel are gathered, that their strength and labour can be
concentrated as the rest of one man, in building up and beautifying the land
of Zion, until the deserts shall blossom as a rose, and her cities, temples,
and towers point to heaven as a token of the fulfilment of the promises of God
unto Israel in the last dispensation and fulness of times. It has been highly
gratifying to me from the beginning, to observe the union of the Saints
throughout the British Isles, and their willingness to abide by the counsel of
the presidency of the church, and sustain every man in his office and calling:
it is upon the principle of union that Zion and Jerusalem are to be build up,
and be prepared for the coming of the Messiah. You have also nobly responded
to the call to assist in rearing unto the name of the Lord, a temple, as the
sequel will show, and also in liberally contributing when other appeals have
been made upon you, for which you will not lose your reward.

Elder Reuben Hedlock is again appointed to the important station of president
over the churches in the British Isles. I have every confidence to believe
that you will uphold and sustain him in his office; he has had much experience
in the church of Christ, and will act for the general good of the cause; you
will be blessed in following his counsel and upholding him by your faith, your
prayers, and good wishes. Elders Thomas Ward, and John Banks are appointed as
counsellors to elder Hedlock, the amount of their talent and labours you have
already ascertained in years gone by. You know them, and will sustain them in
their office--their own works recommend themselves.

I would adivse that the Saints sustain the Star, and give it as wide a
circulation as possible, for it is through this medium that you obtain
constant information. Also use your influence to continue to circulate all our
publications as extensively as possible, for they contain truth, and truth is
mighty and will prevail. Let not the Saints be discouraged because of the
tribulations and sacrifices they are called to pass through; for though the
tongue of slander, the press, and wicked men send forth as upon the wings of
the wind, a flood of falsehood and bitterness against the Saints, yet they
will triumph at last, the earth will be redeemed from the fall, Zion will yet
enjoy all her blessings which have been promised through the mouths of all the
holy prophets since the world began.

I would advise the Saints to keep in view the gathering. I have no doubt but
that there will be doors open for the gathering of the Saints from this land
to meet with their friends who will settle in California, and by uniting
together in wisdom, and going by counsel, much may be done in the continuation
of the emigration.

Before closing this address, I feel disposed, for the benefit and information
of the saints, to lay before you a correct account of the receipts for the
temple, and donations to myself, in conformity with the appeal made at the
last General Conference, also the situation in which I leave the printing
department in Liverpool.

...

Thus have I laid before you a statement of our affairs as I leave them in this
land, and I now conclude by returnig to all my sincere and heartfelt thanks
for all the kindness and assistance which I have received, and pray my
heavenly father to bless the Saints in Britain in all their hands shall find
to do, and speedily make a way for the honest in heart to join their brethren
in the land of Zion, that they may receive their endowments, and be prepared
to be instrumental in consummating his great work, which he will assuredly cut
short in righteousness. Such is my prayer on your behalf, and, beloved Saints,
let myself, my family and others, as well as the Saints in Zion, be ever had
in remembrance by you, that our undertakings may receive the approval of
heaven, and meet with that reward and that rest which remaineth for the people
of God. Amen.
