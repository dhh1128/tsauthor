XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME in his address to the Saints remarked that he was
determined to have order in all things and righteousness should be practiced
in this land that we had come here according to the direction and counsel of
Bro. XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME before his death and that he would still have been
alive if the Twelve had been in XXCITY when he recrossed the river from XXCITY
to XXCITY. He spoke of the Saints being driven from place to place, and said
the only way XXLASTNAME, XXLASTNAME, XXLASTNAME, XXLASTNAME, and all the leaders of the
mob could have been saved in the day of the Lord Jesus would have been to have
come forward voluntarily and let their head been cut off and let their blood
run upon the ground and gone up as a smoking incense before the heavens as an
atonement but now they will be eternally damned. Also said all the
governors--and presidents of the U.S.A. had rejected all our petitions from
first to last, that when the Saints were driven from XXSTATE and perished as
it were on the prairies, then President Polk sends for a draft of XXNUMBER men to
go into the Army. What for? That they might be wasted entirely wasted away as
a people. If the brethren had not gone, they would have made war upon us and
the Governor of XXSTATE would have been ordered not to have let us cross the
XXSTATE and the raising of the battalion was our temporal salvation at the
time and said Polk would be damned for this act and that he with many of the
government men had a hand in the death of Joseph and XXFIRSTNAME and that they
should be damned for these things and if they ever sent any men to interfere
with us here, they shall have their throats cut and sent to hell, and with
uplifted hands to Heaven swore by the Gods of Eternity that He would never
cease His exhortation while he lived to make every preparation and avenge
blood of the Prophets and Saints, that he intended to have every hole and
corner from the Bay of Francisco to Hudson Bay known to us and that our people
would be connected with every tribe of Indians throughout America and that our
people would yet take their squaws, wash and dress them up, teach them our
language and teach them to labor and teach them the gospel of their
forefathers and raise up children by them and teach the children and not many
generations hence they will become a white and delightsome people and in no
other way will it be done and that the time was nigh at hand when the gospel
must go to that people.
