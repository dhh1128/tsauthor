“Our Publications”

Will the elders over the conferences and branches of the church, and all our agents abroad, lay before the Saints the necessity of each family obtaining a copy of the Doctrine and Covenants of the church, as far as they can do so, for it will be a great benefit to them. Each agent ought to have some on hand to supply any person that wishes for them, either in or out of the church. I hope no agent will keep them locked up or hid, for fear some one should see them. Also the Stars should be circulated as extensively as possible to the church and to the world, for it is the medium through which we communicate teaching and instruction to the churches when we cannot be present ourselves. We do not intent the Star to be an uninteresting publication to our readers. We still have Books of Mormon, Hymn Books, Voices of Warning, O. Cowdery’s Letters, and other works on hand, which are of interest to the church and public; and, among others, I wish particularly to mention the fourth and fifth volumes of the Times and Seasons, several hundred copies of which are on hand, edited by elder John Taylor, of Nauvoo; the fifth volume is not quite complete, but we expect the remaining numbers soon. The fourth volume is complete, containing the trials of Joseph Smith, the Prophet, before the courts of justice, the history of the church, and the unparalleled persecution of the Saints. The work will not be reprinted, and when the numbers on hand are disposed of, more cannot be obtained. Each volume contains just double the matter there is in a volume of the Star, price eight shillings per volume. Any agent that can dispose of any of the Times and Seasons, will forward a notice of the same in the order to elder Ward, and they can be supplied.
