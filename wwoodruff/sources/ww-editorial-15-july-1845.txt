Wilford Woodruff, Editorial, Times and Seasons, Vol 6 no 3, July 15, 1845

I wish, now, to make an appeal to the hearts and minds of some ten thousand of my brethren and sisters that reside in this land, by asking you the question, if you are willing to bring your tithes and offerings into the storehouse of the Lord, sufficient to purchase the mouthpiece or bell for the temple of the lord? my faith is that your answer will be yes.

It is justly due to the Liverpool branch of the church to say that, they not only say yes to a bell, but they also say, add a clock to it, and we will not be behind on our part. This is honorable indeed, and I have no doubt, but that, it will meet the feelings of the churches generally, and be pleasing unto them to prove that their tithings and offerings have been laid out to purchase a bell, that when they hear the sound thereof (which may it be the case) they may rejoice that it is the product of their own offerings to the temple of the Lord.

All the churches abroad that will assist us in this thing, will please to forward their donations to me, at Stanley Buildings, Bath Street, Liverpool, with their names and amount of tithings, etc, which will be carefully recorded in the Temple Book, and afterwards transferred to the Book of the Law of the Lord in Nauvoo.
