I have not presented the full minutes of these conferences, but have endeavoured to give the remarks in a brief manner. I rejoice to find these conferences we visited so well united and prosperous in the principles of the Gospel. Elders Holmes and Hardy will take their departure together, for New York or Boston, about the 16th of October. Though their missions to England have been limited to about ten months, yet it has been interesting to themselves and of much benefit to the Saints. Although we shall feel the loss of these dear brethren, and miss their society, yet, as duty calls them home, we feel to bid them God speed to the bosom of their families, homes and friends, and the City of Joseph, with all the prayers, blessings, and the good wishes to rest upon their heads, from the many Saints with whom they have formed an acquaintance in this land.
