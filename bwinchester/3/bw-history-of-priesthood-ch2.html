It appears from what is left on record of the age in which XXPROPHET lived,
that the foundation of the heathen mythology was laid, and that a large
portion of the world digressed from the path of rectitude and righteousness,
and were fast tending forward to that disgraceful confusion and idolatry, that
they afterward were thrust into; however, I admit that some few strictly
adhered to the principles of righteousness, and that the majority of the
nations retained some few vestiges of the pure religion of heaven; as is
evident from many things that are recorded in connection with the history of
XXPROPHET, and those immediately connected with him. The Lord therefore,
foreseeing the result of this apostacy, called XXPROPHET and commanded him to
leave the land of his nativity, and go into the land of Canaan. It seems, that
the object the Lord had in view in doing this, was to cause a knowledge of him
to be retained on earth, which was likely to be lost among those who had
turned to idolatry. In order to accomplish this, the Lord resolved to raise up
from XXPROPHET, a choice nation, and peculiar people; -- hence, the Israelites
were to be the repositories of his knowledge.

As soon as XXPROPHET reached the land of Canaan, the Lord appeared to him and
made known in full his intentions, which were as above, and ceded to him and
his posterity after him forever and ever, all the land that he could see from
an eminent place on which he stood; He also promised him that his progeny
should be, comparatively speaking, as numerous as the stars of heaven, and
that in and through his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed.
All these considerations were included in the covenant the Lord made with him.

Now the matter seems to stand thus, the Lord in order to accomplish his
purposes, resolved to raise up a people and commit to them his oracles or the
holy priesthood, and make them the repositories of his knowledge, and stewards
over the affairs of his kingdom. This forms a most exquisite solution of the
scriptural doctrine of election and reprobation.The prophets, Christ, and the
apostles, unanimously agree that the Israelite nation, were the chosen or
elect people of God; or in other words, they were the chosen seed. The idea
is, they were elected to hold the office of the priesthood, that all the world
might be blessed through their administration; -- for indeed, Christ after the
flesh was a descendant of XXPROPHET. In a scriptural sense, the whole Gentile
world were reprobated; that is, they were not chosen to hold the office of the
priesthood, or to be stewards over the affairs of the kingdom; but this
reprobation did not effect their salvation in eternity, provided they were
adopted into the family of XXPROPHET or kingdom of God, through obedience to
the proper ordinances, administered by those holding the office of the
priesthood.

Paul, speaking of this chosen people, says: "..." * The adoption alluded to
here, is already explained in the preceding chapter. -- All the covenants that
God ever made with any people respecting priesthood and blessings, are
embodied in those made with the house of Israel. The servicealluded to,
appears to be that of the priests, while acting in their official capacity,
and not the devotional service required of all mankind: for the former was
restricted to the Israelites. Christ said: "..." † All the inspired writers,
hold forth the idea, that God elected the Israelite nation to be stewards over
the affairs of His house or Kingdom, and to hold the office of the priesthood,
by virtue of which, all the world could be transplanted into the family of
XXPROPHET, and be numbered with the "..." and sustain an allegiance with God;
hence, came the saying; "..." The Lord commanded XXPROPHET, Isaac, Jacob, and
all the house of Israel, to circumcise all the males of their families, which
was to be as a sign, or token of their relationship with Israel; and that they
might be preserved a separate and distinct people by themselves, and not mix
with other nations. The covenant made with XXPROPHET concerning the land of
Canaan, circumcision, and the multiplication of his posterity, was extra of
the covenant of priesthood, which he had received the same as others had
before him. The foregoing may be regarded an a slight digression from our
subject; but in order to have a correct understanding of the priesthood in
this age, it is necessary to have correct information with regard to the
object the Lord had in view, in raising up the Israelite nation in the manner
in which he did.

The first thing, that I shall now introduce as evidence to prove that the
priesthood was conferred upon man in this age, is the fact that the gospel was
preached in it. Paul says: "..." * This is conclusive that the gospel was
preached to XXPROPHET; but the following is more definite still: "..." The
administration of bread and wine as a sacrament, is one of the institutions of
the gospel, and was practiced by Christ and his apostles; and no doubt,
Melchizedek administered them with the same views, and for the same purpose,
that the disciples of Christ did.

The profound reverence that Abimeleck king of Gerar, who took XXPROPHET's wife
from him supposing she was his sister, had for the Lord, and the principles of
virtue and righteousness, is sufficient evidence that he was acquainted with
the religion of heaven, and proves to a demonstration, that the law of
righteousness; or in other words, the gospel, was understood in his day. Paul
expressly says, the gospel was preached to the children of Israel in the
wilderness, Eusebius Pamphfus, bishop of Cessrae in Palestine, one of the
noted fathers of the church, who flourished in the fourth century, has written
in his "..." a whole chapter to prove that the gospel of Christ was no new
thing; but was preached, not only in the days of XXPROPHET, but long before
his day. This is of [undoubted] authority; for Eusebius had a good opportunity
to become acquainted with the history of this circumstance. ‡ The foregoing
abundantly sustains the idea, that the gospel was preached, understood, and
even obeyed, in the age in which XXPROPHET lived; but we will now turn our
attention, more particularly, to the priesthood, abstract from other
principles.

I have before mentioned that XXPROPHET, had the priesthood; and in all
probability, he was ordained by Melchizedek: for it is said, that when he
returned from the slaughter of the kings, Melchizedek met, and blessed him. --
I suppose XXPROPHET was ordained during this interview.

This Melchizedek, who was priest of the most high God and king of Salem, was
an extraordinary man in his day; a man of great faith and piety; although,
there are some things connected with his history, that are very singular. He
no doubt enjoyed all the privileges of the priesthood, and by virtue of the
same, reigned as patriarch or king over Salem; and so great was his faith, and
fame, that after his day, the priesthood was called after his name. Mr.
XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME explains this as follows: "..." There is an apparent
contradiction, in the account given by the apostle Paul of this great man: I
mean the following: "..." Some have considered the saving, "..." sufficient
ground for a great many enthusiastic speculations: for instance, that
Melchizedek is Christ, or Jehovah; also that he was not a man. But the
absurdity of such notions, is seen from the succeeding verses; "..." "..."
From these declarations we discover that this Melchizedek was a man, and had
descent; but what does the apostle mean by saying that he was "..." I answer
that he did not allude either to the person of Christ or Melchizedek; for each
had a father and mother; but to the principle of authority or the holy
priesthood, which has existed from all eternity, and has neither father,
mother, or descent; and is without beginning in days, or end of life. The
apparent contradiction in the apostles phraseology, in all probability, has
appeared in consequence of the ignorance of the translator, or some careless
transcriber.

The apostle holds out the idea, that this priesthood is a kingly one, which
appears to be correct, from the fact, that it emanated from God, and He is a
King of kings, and Lord of lords; and it is also the authority of his kingdom,
and by it, as I have before mentioned, Melchizedek reigned as a king over the
inhabitants of the city of Salem. This idea is corroborated by Josephus, who
says: "..." * From this we learn that the Melchizedek priesthood, may be with
propriety termed, the Righteous kingly priesthood; or to reverse it, a Kingly
priesthood or authority adopted to the law of righteousness.

It is evident that the only form of government, by which the people were
governed in these early times, that met the approbation of the Lord was the
Patriarchal. This government, was strictly ecclesiastical, yet it included all
the rules and regulations necessary for the well-being of society, and
preservation of good morals. The chief ruler was the patriarch, or
high-priest, who reigned as king by virtue of the office of the priesthood
which he held. Indeed, there are reasons for believing, that all those small
kingdoms of the land of Canaan, including those governed by the shepherd
kings, were originally only so many branches of the kingdom of God, and each
formed a separate organization by itself yet all probably were accountable to
a presiding officer, or quorum of officers appointed by the Lord to preside
ever the whole kingdom on earth.

Melchizedek presided over a church, or branch of the kingdom of this kind,
which was at Salem; and in all probability, Abimeleck of Gerar, was a king of
this description. All the shepherds kings, and those of Canaan, originally
presided by virtue of this priesthood; but as these kingdoms degenerated into
apostacy, they incorporated with their religion, many mythological
institutions; their government many political, despotic, forms and rules, and
each king in time assumed the title of absolute monarch. I infer all this,
from some few hints dropped by the sacred historians: for instance, such as
the account of Melchizedek reigning as king, in Salem, the profound reverence
that Abimeleck had for the Lord, many things connected with the biography of

XXPROPHET, the circumstance of XXPROPHET finding a priest among the
Midianites, who had a knowledge of God, the whole history of, Baalam the
prophet, (who in one instance however is called a soothsayer,) and many other
allusions to the condition of the nations, with regard to their relationship
with God, too numerous to mention. One thing is certain, no people so much
deserve the extreme severity of God's judgments, as a set of apostates; and it
is evident that these kingdoms had corrupted the holy priesthood, sacrificed
to idols, and turned their temples into public brothel houses. They thus
provoked the Lord, and kindled the flame of his anger against them, till he
sent the Israelites to destroy and dispossess them. This idea of their being
apostates, in a great measure, accounts for the severity of his judgments upon
them. It also sustains our idea of the object the Lord had in view in raising
up the Israelite nation.

For proof, that the priesthood existed on earth in the days of XXPROPHET, I
refer the reader to the apostle, Paul's epistle to the Hebrews, particularly
to the seventh chapter. XXPROPHET in his brief account of this age frequently
mentions that there were eldersand priests; but some of the modern writers,
conjecture they were idolators. This is only supposition and be it as it may,
it is evident the authority used in the heathen temples or at their alters was
only a corruption of the holy priesthood. God first initiated the offering of
sacrifices, (not however to idolatrous gods,) and gave the appropriate names
to the various grades or office, and when the nations degenerated into
idolatry, they retained these names, and sacrificed to their deities.

It is said, when Jacob died: "..." It is also said, that Joseph married the
daughter of the priest of On. † And when we consider the piety of Joseph his
untiring zeal in the cause of righteousness, and avertion to idolatry, we
cannot for a moment suppose that such an alliance was made with the daughter
of an idolatrous priest; not that Joseph would have polluted his piety by so
doing; but the antipathy that existed against each other's religion, would
have imposed a barrier in the way. If the foregoing quotations are not
positive, I regard them at any rate, as the strongest kind of presumptive
evidence, to sustain the before mentioned idea of the priesthood. I cannot
consistently close this chapter, without saying something more of what is
written in the XXSCRIP, who in all probability lived in this age. -- What he
say's about the "..." sustains our idea that there were many people in this
age who had a knowledge of the Lord, and who had received the benefits of the
priesthood, and then formed an allegiance with God, and were numbered with his
family.

The probability is, that this priesthood was conferred by the father upon the
son. [From] XXPROPHET to Joseph; moreover it is quite probable, that the
twelve sons of Jacob were all priests, for they are regarded as patriarchs.
But after the decease of Joseph it seems that idolatry triumphed in Egypt. --
The Israelites were reduced to bondage, and how much they feared God and
respected the rules of his kingdom, from this to XXPROPHET, is uncertain.
