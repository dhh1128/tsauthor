THE ORIGIN OF THE SPAULDING STORY, CONCERNING THE MANUSCRIPT FOUND; WITH A
SHORT BIOGRAPHY OF DR. P. HULBERT, THE ORIGINATOR OF THE SAME; AND SOME
TESTIMONY ADDUCED SHOWING IT TO BE A SHEER FABRICATION, SO FAR AS ITS
CONNECTION WITH THE BOOK OF MORMON IS CONCERNED.

THE following work is not designed as a vindication of the peculiar tenets of
the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints—but simply as an exposition
of the means used, by the enemy of all righteousness, to stop the progress of
inquiry, and prejudice the minds of those who know little or nothing of the
religious faith of those who believe the Book of Mormon an inspired record of
a fallen people; and thereby prevent examination and investigation. The writer
has therefore esteemed it a duty devolving on him, to make a statement of
facts coming under his own inspection; as well as those with which he has had
ample opportunity of becoming cognizant. [2]

THE ORIGIN OF THE SPAULDING STORY CONCERNING THE MANUSCRIPT FOUND.

As the public mind has been somewhat agitated for the last nine or ten years,
upon the subject of Mormonism, (so called,) and as there have been coined and
put in circulation, innumerable statements respecting its origin, and all of
them contrary the one to the other; I deem it an act of justice to a belied
people, and a deceived public, knowing the facts of the case, to present them
to the truth of the matter, and to know the contradictions

and absurdities, which are swallowed greedily down, without question or
examination, because men love darkness rather than light.

THE Spaulding tale of a ‘manuscript found,’ seems to be the basis, from
which the vast multitude of ephemeral lies derive their very existence. I
shall, therefore, address myself to the task of its entire demolition, so far
as it has any thing to do with the book of Mormon; when the superstructure
reared thereon, will fall to the ground of necessity.

I shall, in the first place, relate a few of the incidents that brought me in
connexion with the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints; and in the
next, give a short biography of Doct. P. Hurlbert, who first originated the
above tale; and thirdly, compare his testimony, with that of others of his
coadjutors; and I think that the sequel will clearly disclose it to be a base
fabrication, as notorious as that invented eighteen hundred years
ago;—"..."

In the month of November, 1832, I, for the first time, had the privilege of
attending a meeting which was addressed [3] by an elder of the church to which
I now belong. I then resided in Erie Co., Pa. I was much prejudiced, and
supposed them to be among the greatest of impostors, and their doctrine to be
a delusion of the worst kind, I had imbibed these opinions from newspapers,
and public rumour, which represented them as holding all things common, being
seditious, and denouncing the bible, and being led on by a set of men devoid
of every moral principle, and ripe for any enormity. The better to secure
their hellish purposes, they had invented a new code of morals, embodied in
the golden bible.

With these by no means favourable prepossessions, I was curious to hear these
distinguished emissaries of his satanic majesty, as I verily supposed them to
be. After entering the house where the meeting was appointed, I beheld a young
man in the act of commencing the services, by reading a chapter in the new
testament; this somewhat astonished me. He addressed the people on the subject
of the gospel of Christ; and seemed only solicitous to impress upon his
hearers, the necessity of obeying the gospel. And instead of learning some new
fangled doctrine, as I expected, contrary to that taught by the Saviour and
his apostles, I heard the very doctrine Christ commanded his disciples to go
and preach; and the very words the apostles used, enforced upon his hearers;
he insisted upon the absolute necessity of obeying all the commandments of
God; and showed what the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, as taught
by the apostles were, as follows: 1st, To believe in God, and in Jesus Christ
his son, and that the only plan of saving men, is through the gospel, see Gal.
i. 9;—2nd, Repent of, and forsake you sins; 3, Baptism for the remission of
sins, see Acts ii, 38;—4th, the laying on of hands for the reception of the
Holy Ghost. This he demonstrated to be a commandment of the Lord, and an
ordinance of the gospel, as much as any other contained in the new testament,
by the following passages: Acts, viii, 17,—xix, 6,—Heb. vi, 2. He also
contended that the children of men take the new testament for their rule of
faith and practice, in the present age of the world, as in any other; and that
the church of Jesus Christ be organized on the plan therein directed, see 1
Cor. 12th chap.; Ephesians, 4th chap.

I immediately recognized this as the doctrine of the Bible, and that there is
no such thing as believing the [4] Bible and denying the doctrines contained
therein. Indeed it commended itself to my conscience in the sight of God.

The next meeting he held, the congregation was addressed on the coming forth
of the Book of Mormon. This was a new and a strange thing brought to the ears
of this generation. The eyes of the people, however, were opened to understand
the scriptures, which testify of the work

of the Lord in the last days, and the manner of its accomplishment. The
visions of the prophets were unfolded, and many of their declarations shown to
be fulfilling before our eyes. The subject assumed a majesty and glory, which
altogether surprised and captivated the audience; and we discovered that the
stone cut out of the mountain without hands, and which should ultimately fill
the whole earth, had already began to roll. That God had indeed chosen the
foolish things of this world to confound the wise, and the weak things to
confound the mighty. Other appointments to preach were made in other places,
in the appointments to preach were made in other places, in the neighbourhood;
and the same commotion which the ancient gospel produced, was found still to
accompany its promulgation. Some received the truth in the love of it, others
used every exertion to withstand it. After I had heard several discourses on
the fulness of the gospel, I felt anxious to ally myself to a people who were
every where spoken against, and sought the earliest opportunity of doing it;
accordingly, I went forward and was baptised. This was in the month of
January, 1833; shortly after this, quite a number, seventy or eighty, were
baptised and added to the church.

Thus mightily grew the work of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit was poured out.
Other elders began to visit us from other parts of the United States. This
brought me acquainted with many of them, among them appeared the famous Doct.
P. Hulbert, some of whose writings I shall examine. He was at this time,
April, 1833, an elder. The numbers of the church having increased, and the
desire to hear considerable, in the surrounding country, it was thought best
for him to remain and fill the calls. Dr. P. Hulbert resided at Jamestown,
N.Y., previous to his embracing the profession of a Latter Day Saint, and was
a member of the Methodist E. Church, and was for some time a class leader, and
then an exhorter and local preacher; but was expelled for unvirtuous conduct
with a young lady; at length he embraced the faith of the church [5] of Latter
Day Saints, and soon started for Kirtland, Ohio; ostensibly to cultivate an
acquaintance with the brethren there. On his way, he passed through the place
in which I resided; he was not ordained at this time; while at Kirtland he was
ordained to the office of elder, and shortly returned to Pennsylvania, and
commenced preaching as before mentioned. The members of the church at this
time had confidence in him as a man of God; but this was soon shaken by his
conduct. Dr. P. H. was a man of some parts, and evidently from his conduct and
bearing, fully conscious of his power, and while conversing with the other
elders or more humble character and acquirements, he often exhibited the
spirit of big I and little u.

While in this region of country, he made several converts in Crawford county,
Pa. He frequently called, and stayed over night at my father’s; which
afforded me an opportunity of forming a correct estimate of the man. The
church ultimately lost their confidence in him, in consequence of the
discovery, that the organ of amativeness, philoprogenitiveness, or some other
organ, not of a moral mould, was unduly developed, and that the gratification
of these propensities manifested itself in numerous peccadillos, disgraceful
to the man, and calculated to bring upon him the reproach of every lover of
virtue and correct morals; so much so, that he was cast off from the church,
and his license taken from him by the conference; at first he appeared
impenitent and obdurate, but afterwards professed penitence and humility; he
soon left for Kirtland, to appeal to the general conference, when his case was
reheard, and, in consequence of confession and acknowledgement, his license
was restored. In returning into Pennsylvania, he stopped at Thompson, Geauga
county, Ohio, and immediately commenced his old practices, in attempting to
seduce a young female, but Providence interposing, frustrated his diabolical
designs. For this crime he was immediately expelled from the church, and his
license called for, but he refused to give it up. On discovering he had
irretrieveably ruined himself with the church,

his tactics were changed, and he now determined to demolish, as far as
practicable, what he had once endeavoured to build up. Now his nefarious
purposes were frustrated, he sought to obtain revenge in this manner. Not
because he did not conscientiously believe the work of God, as proclaimed by
the Latter Day Saints, but because he had rather enjoy the pleasures of sin,
which are but for a sea- [6] son. And now he could no longer hide himself
under the cloak of religion, and have a name with the people of God, because
his wickedness was brought to light, and proclaimed as on the house top.

Therefore, he determined like a true son of the old Apostate, to take a firm
stand against God and his truth. He accordingly repaired to Springfield, Pa.;
in which place he held forth for the first time. From that place he came to
the neighbourhood where I resided. I would here observe, that while he was in
connexion with the church of Latter Day Saints, the preachers and priests of
the different denominations heaped their calumny upon the Society for
fellowshipping him; and made a stumbling block of him, and said there was no
mark of a christian about him. But no sooner had he made his appearance as the
campion of sectarianism, and the assailant of Mormonism, than churches,
chapels, and meeting-houses were crowded to hear him. By this time the
doctrine of Jesus Christ had been proclaimed there about six months. The
priests and people had been engaged, with all their powers, to suppress the
work; their exertions, however, were fruitless, and the work of the Lord
continued to roll on in majesty and power; truth triumphed, and the number of
the disciples was greatly multiplied. In this condition of things, the sudden
appearance of Dr. P. Hurlbert among them, afforded an opportunity for the
Devil to rally his forces once more, and renew his attack; their zeal was
again renewed, and their hopes reinvigorated, and the cry was down with
Mormonism.

I attended the first lecture that was delivered in the neighbourhood, and
there I beheld priest and people listening with breathless anxiety, to see and
hear Mormonism forever demolished, and utterly overthrown, with as much
interest, apparently, as the Pharisees waited the decision of Pilate, on the
death of Jesus Christ. I say, with so great avidity did they drink in the
falsehoods, misrepresentations, and calumnies of this modern Julian. The
inebriate shout, and the ribald jest, evinced, in a manner not to be mistaken,
how welcome the work which he was performing, was to his hearers: there were
men, who had never been to hear a single discourse by our people, exclaiming,
how true he does it, "..." Those who had been engaged in
overthrowing the cause of God, were inspirited to fresh effort, and renewed
hope of succeeding [7] in obtaining a signal victory, and that its
promulgators would flee the country in disgrace.

The now Rev. Mr. Hulbert was petted and patronised by priest and people, and
every accommodation afforded him. After spending two or three months in that
region of the country, lecturing, it was quite manifest to him that his plan
had completely failed to secure his purposes. He resolved, therefore, to try a
new experiment, and that was to forge a lie, and make it look as plausible as
possible.

After having pursued the history of this individual so far, we shall now
proceed to detail the precise manner in which the Spaulding story originated,
respecting the manuscript found, which, it is supposed by some, has been
transmuted in to the Book of Mormon.

In doing this, I shall be led to notice the proceedings of the fabricator of
the same, while engaged in maturing his infamous project.

During the six or eight months that Mr. H. was preaching in the State of
Pennsylvania, (part of the time he belonged to the church, and part of it he
was lecturing against it;) he formed a large circle of acquaintance, and
mingled with all sorts and classes of people. While in a small

village, called the Jackson settlement, (a place that is famous for infidels,)
he became familiar with a family of the name of Jackson, and others, who were
personally acquainted with the now celebrated Solomon Spaulding, who is
reputed to be the legitimate author of the Book of Mormon. Here, while in
conversation with them, Mr. H. learned that Mr. S., while alive, wrote a work
called the Manuscript Found. Not that any of these persons had the most
distant idea that this novel had ever been converted into the Book of Mormon;
or that there was any connexion between them. Indeed, Mr. Jackson, who had
read both the Book of Mormon, and Spaulding’s manuscript, told Mr. H. when
he came to get his signature to a writing, testifying to the probability that
Mr. S.’s manuscript had been converted into the Book of Mormon; that there
was no agreement between them; for, said he, Mr. S.’s manuscript was a very
small work, in the form of a novel, saying not one word about the children of
Israel, but professed to give an account of a race of people who originated
form the Romans, which Mr. S. said he had translated from a Latin parchment
that he had found. The Book of Mormon, he added, purports to be written by a
branch of the house of Israel; is written in a different [8] style, and
altogether different; for this reason Mr. Jackson refused to lend his name to
the lie, and expressed his indignation and contempt at the base and wicked
project to deceive the public.

Mr. Jackson was a disinterested man, and a good citizen.

Mr. H., after learning that such a novel had been written, in order to carry
out his designs, resolved to make the fact, that a novel had been written, the
foundation of a notorious fabrication; and at the same time make it appear as
plausible as possible, to deceive the world, and induce them to account for
the origin of the Book of Mormon in some other way than the truth.

After Mr. H. had learned what I have before mentioned, he immediately repaired
to Kirtland, Ohio, and made an appointment to deliver a lecture, on what he
called Anti- Mormonism; and made a special request that all who were opposed
to the church of Latter Day Saints should attend, which they did, both priest
and people, and composed a council, which I suppose resembled strongly the
conclave of Hell, or the Jewish Sanhedrin, when they met to put down Jesus and
his doctrine.

Here Mr. H. had ample opportunity to display his talent for talking, to a
people who listened with breathless attention, and were greedy in devouring
his words, expecting to hear some great secret divulged. Mr. H. told them that
he had been travelling in the State of Pennsylvania, lecturing against
Mormonism; and that he had learned that one Mr. Spaulding had written a
romance, and the probability was, that it had, by some means, fallen into the
hands of Sidney Rigdon, and that he had converted it into the Book of Mormon.
Mr. H. stated also, that he intended to write a book, called Mormonism
Unveiled, which he said would divulge the whole secret.

His auditors were much elated at the idea, and one of the a Campbellite, by
name, Newel, and a notorious mobocrat in the bargain, advanced the sum of
three hundred dollars, for the prosecution of the work; others of them
contributed for the same purpose, and expressed their desire for it to be
hastened as fast as possible. After receiving such encouragement, he proceeded
immediately to prosecute his hellish purposes with more courage than ever, and
was immediately fitted out, and started in search of the above manuscript. He
proceeded as far as New Salem, the place where Mr. S. lived, when he wrote his
manuscript found; and [9] called a meeting, and made known his intentions.
This meeting caused considerable stir in the place, and was attended by a
number of the citizens. Mr. H. mentioned to them that he had learned that one
Mr. Spaulding, several years since, had written a novel, while living in that
place, and the probability

was, that S. Rigdon had by some means obtained it, and converted it into the
Book of Mormon. This idea was new to them, however, they were pleased with it,
and Mr. H.’s project seemed to them a good one; Mr. H. therefore received
their support in the shape of some money, and was advised to visit Mr.
Spaulding’s widow, now Mrs. Davieson, who resided in Monson, Mass.; and
learn if possible all the particulars concerning the matter. I ought to
mention that the doctrine of Jesus Christ, had been propagated with
considerable success, in the region round New Salem; and had caused there as
it every where does, no small stir among the people. And the enemies of truth,
had there exhausted all their ingenuity, to put a stop to the progress of
righteousness; but still the number of the disciples was daily multiplied. The
Spaulding story was never dreamed of, till Mr. H. mentioned it,
notwithstanding this was said to be the identical place where the thing was
written. But to my history.

Mr. H. immediately repaired to Monson, Mass., to see Mrs. Davieson, who, after
Mr. H. presented his object, gave him the writings of her former husband;
(this, Mr. H. says himself, in Mormonism unveiled, and also in priest
Storrs’ history of the origin of Momonism,) and told him there was a trunk
somewhere in the state of New York, which also contained some papers which he
might have if they were found to suit his purpose; Mr. H. says, he found
nothing in this trunk that would suit his purpose.

By the way, while Mr. H. was on his way to Mass., he called at Palmyra, N. Y.,
and some of the adjoining towns, and obtained the signatures of several men,
bitter and declared enemies of Joseph Smith, Jun., testifying many hard things
concerning him, which has exalted his character very much in the estimation of
every disinterested person, from the fact, that it is an honour a man to be
slandered by a set of blackguards, liars, horse jockeys, and drunkards; but to
proceed, Mr. H. while in conversation with Mrs. Davieson, learned that Mr. S.
removed from New Salem to Pittsburgh, Pa., in the year 1812; and in a short
time after, to Amity, Washington Co. [10] Pa. and deceased in the year 1816;
this information was thought to help along the project admirably, and no
sooner had Mr. H. returned to New Salem, than it was thought best, that he
should immediately repair to Pittsburgh, and Mr. S.’s manuscript had ever
been left there. Now the whole aim and object of this project, was to make the
public believe, that Sidney Rigdon was the real author of the Book of Mormon.
It is a fact easily apprehended, that if a man or set of men, undertake to
palm an abominable lie upon the public, they will endeavour to make it as
plausible as possible. Therefore, knowing that S. Rigdon had resided in
Pittsburgh for a certain length of time, he had endeavoured to make the
finding of the manuscript take place at Pittsburgh, and then infer, that S. R.
had coppied it there.

After Mr. H. returned from Pittsburgh, he went to Kirtland, Ohio, and stopped
in that region of country, as he said, to learn other particulars, and finish
writing his book. Mr. H. had not been there long before he threatened to
murder Joseph Smith, Jun., for which he was bound over in the sum of five
hundred dollars, to keep the peace. While there, his best friend began to lose
confidence in him, his reputation waned rapidly, and the dark side of his
character began to develope itself more fully, and he began to play his old
pranks.

Those who were anxious that Mr. Hulbert’s work should come out discovered it
would not do to publish it in his name, his reputation was too rotten; they
advised him therefore, to sell it to Mr. E. D. Howe, of Painesville, Ohio, for
five hundred dollars. Mr. H. got the money, and gave up his manuscript, thus
Mormonism Unveiled, became the adopted offspring of Mr. Howe; indeed
Hulbert’s name was cancelled in many places. These are facts, and can be
proven by hundreds of unimpeachable witnesses in that region of country.

Mr. Hulbert with his ill gotten gains, went to Erie county, Pa., in the
township of Girard, Miller Settlement, and bought a farm, and married a wife,
soon became a confirmed drunkard, spent every cent of his inglorious gain, was
reduced to beggary, took to stealing for a livelihood, was detected in
stealing a log chain, fled the country, to esc1ape justice, and that is the
last of him, so far as I know. I have written this short biography of Dr.* P.
[11] Hulbert, that my readers may know the character of the man who first
invented the Spaulding lie.—Also that they may know the merit of him whom
the priests of this day, to serve their purpose, have dubbed honourable,
reverend, &c.

As respects "..." published by E. D. Howe—its
circulation in the west was trifling. They knew too much about it; the persons
by whom, and the way in which it was got up. Therefore it died a natural
death, in a very little while; and, instead of Mr. Howe making a fortune by
it, as he expected, the edition became a burden to him. He offered them at
less than half price, and could not get rid of them even then. Instead of
doing harm to the church of Latter Day Saints, it did good, for this reason:
there had been as much noise made about it as if a mountain were in labour,
and when the delivery came, behold it was a mouse. It was boldly affirmed that
Mormonism was to receive its death blow: when the blow came, there was no
force in it. Vague conjecture, improbabilities, and abuse, were the
ingredients of which it was made.

Notwithstanding the downfall of "..." and the complete
prostration of this scheme of the Devil and his emissaries in the West, a new
version of the thing has been published by the religious editors of New York,
who have asserted its incontrovertible truth; and by their positive
affirmation, succeeded in deceiving some with an exploded lie, acknowledged as
such in the section of country where it was begotten.

Still another version has made its appearance, emanating form one Mr. Storrs,
a Congregationalist priest, of Holliston, Mass., which has come before the
world in a different form—in fact they completely annihilate each other.
Last of all, it has been re-dressed , and re- touched, in some of the papers
of this city, in a manner likely to deceive some, who are unacquainted with
the facts; and it is on this account particularly, that I have undertaken the
present statement of facts.

I will now proceed to examine them specifically—compare them with each
other, and expose thereby their positive falsehood, by the contradictions
which they contain.

First, of Priest Storrs’ version of the story, purporting to be signed by
Matilda Davieson, the relict of Solomon Spaulding.

This immaculate gentleman commences by remarking, [12] "..." Does the reverend falsifier know, that the Latter Day Saints
esteem the Scriptures so highly, that they denounce the whole sectarian world
as apostates, on the ground that they have so lightly prized them, as to
renounce a certain part thereof, by saying they are non-essential? Answer,
Yes, assuredly.

It is next asserted, that Mr. Spaulding removed from New Salem to Pittsburgh,
Pa. Here Mr. S. found an acquaintance and friend in the person of Mr.
Patterson, an editor of a newspaper. He exhibited his manuscript to Mr. P.,
who was very much pleased with itand borrowed it for perusal.

Now, if Mr. Patterson’s testimony can be relied on, this statement is false;
for, as soon as it appeared in public, Mr. Green called on Mr. P., to know if
this statement was true. Mr. P.

*Doctor is not the title of his profession, he being the seventh son, his
mother saw proper to name him doctor.

replied, that he knew nothing of any such manuscript. I learned this from Mr.
Green’s own mouth, who is a man of undoubted veracity. I suppose the pious
priest of Holliston was labouring under the hallucination of trusting to his
cloth to cover his naked fabrication. A very rotten dependence, truly! Mr.
Hulbert states, that he called on Mr. Patterson, who affirmed his entire
ignorance of the whole matter. The author of "..." and
"..." are clearly at work unwittingly destroying each
other.

Again, it is asserted, that "..." Sidney Rigdon was never connected
with any such office, for the simple reason, that no such office was in
existence while Mr. R. resided in Pittsburgh! Mr. Patterson kept a book and
stationary establishment at that time, and had no connection whatever with Mr.
Rigdon. The author of the "..." has therefore been guilty
of forging, inventing, or circulating a demonstrative falsehood; and however
he may attempt to screen himself under his sanctimoniousness, the covering
cannot hide him. The horns and the hoof will betray, in spite of himself, and
exhibit the folly of the concealed culprit. "..."

But again. "..." The
intention of the whole scheme is manifestly to create the impression that S.
Rigdon had a share in its production, if he was not the sole author of the
Book of Mormon. Almighty God always does his work so as effectually to
preclude the possibility of its ever being mistaken for the work of man, by
the lover of truth; and the attempt of the father of lies to make a show of
accounting for the Book of Mormon, in some other way than the truth, will not
deceive a single honest heart, whose motto is, "..."

That Mr. Rigdon lived in Pittsburgh between the years 1822 and 1826, no one
disputes; but that he had any thing to do with the compilation of the Book of
Mormon, we utterly deny. In fact, he did not know of its existence until years
after, as we are prepared to show. Let us, however, see how the statements
tally. Mr. Spaulding wrote his manuscript in New Salem, Ohio, in the year
1812: from thence he removed to Pittsburgh. Here the ingenious author
carefully conceals the time when he removed to Pittsburgh. Why? Because he
would be building his fabric with one hand, and pulling it about his ears with
the other. Mr. Hulbert says the widow of Mr. Spaulding informed him, that the
removal to Pittsburgh took place in 1812, and from thence to Amity, in 1814.
Mrs. Davieson is made to say in the "..." that, "..."
Admitting this—all the time, and the only time S. Rigdon had an opportunity,
or possibility, of becoming acquainted with the manuscript, was between 1812
and 1814; for since that time, it has been carefully kept by Mrs. Davieson. S.
Rigdon is now forty-seven years of age—consequently was born in 1793; and in
1812, of course, was only nineteen years of age. I learned from his mother,
before the Spaulding story was ever thought of, that he lived at home, and
worked on the farm, until the twenty-sixth year of his age, and was never
engaged in public life until after this period, either politically or
religiously. Any one who can credit that a plough boy, nineteen or twenty
years of age, who had lived a secluded life from his infancy, could set to
work to copy a manuscript necessary for a book of six hundred pages, and
secrete it twenty years, without the slightest apparent reason under heaven,
can find no difficulty in believing Mahomet’s account of the seventeenth
heaven. Mark, [14] Mrs. Davieson says she had it form 1814 to the time of Mr.
Hulbert’s application, in her own possession: couple that with the fact,
that S. Rigdon never lived in Pittsburgh until after 1822!

eight or ten years after the manuscript was in the careful preservation of
Mrs. Davieson!! The very lame attempt at something like precision, by affixing
names and dates, is then the key by which the whole plot is unravelled and
exploded. Another extract from the "..." is as
follows: "..." As I lived close by New
Salem at this time, I knew all the Elders of this church who visited New
Salem. I have reason to know that no such meeting as that herein described
ever took place; especially as we never had a female teacher in the church! We
do not allow any such impropriety. This account moreover says, that John
Spaulding, brother of Solomon, was present at this meeting, and "..."

In the first place, Mr. J. S. does not live in New Salem, or in the state! And
in the next, it is a very strange thing that a saint of God should be engaged
in manufacturing a Romance, (lies!) to palm upon the public as truth:
surprising consistency!! We will match this with an extract from Mr. Hulbert.
"..." neither does their witness agree together, and it is clear
whose servants they are, because his works they do. Mr. Hulbert is said to be
deputed by some others to visit Mass., to obtain from Mrs. Davieson the
original manuscript; we have examined this more particularly in the former
part of our remarks; priest Storrs evidently borrowed this idea from the
veracious gentleman himself.

The far famed manuscript, it is said, was delivered up to Hulbert, by Mrs.
Davieson, and that is the last of it. Where is it now? Why has it not been
published long ago? Simply because it would have branded their statements with
everlasting infamy. It is certainly of sufficient moment to warrant a
publication, and the interest these [15] gentlemen have taken in the matter,
proves, beyond all doubt, that they consider it so. Will these pious and
patriotic citizens not lend a hand to undeceive some hundreds of thousands of
human beings, in an affair of such intrinsic importance, when it can be done
with such ease, and withal so effectually. With all their pretension to
christian philanthropy, what is the position they now occupy; according to
their own showing, multitudes have, and are continually receiving a book as of
divine origin, and moulding their faith and practice therefrom, when these men
start up and declare we have discovered it is all a gross imposition! it was
written by a man for amusement! we have the identical manuscript from which it
was copied; and yet refuse to bring it to light! Do not these men stand
convicted in every honourable mind, with being either recreant to their duty,
as teachers of religion, or wilfully blinding and deceiving the people. One of
these must be true, and we think there is no difficulty in determining which,
when it is remembered how zealous these men have been in using every means in
their power to withstand the progress of truth. [16]

. . . Having said so much respecting the manuscript found, I shall add a few
more remarks, and then close the subject. Sufficient has already been said to
prove clearly to every candid mind, that the whole story is not reconcilable
with the facts, as stated by the originators themselves, and by its various
contradictions completely destroys itself, and proves it to be a base
fabrication.

It is evident, from Hulbert’s own statement, that he obtained the manuscript
from Mrs. Davieson; but, after comparing it with the Book of Mormon, he found
there was no correspondence or similarity between them, either in style or
contents: therefore, to cover his own shame, he resorts to the supposition,
without a particle of presumptive evidence, that S.

Spaulding had written a different kind of novel, and the probability was, that
it had been converted into the Book of Mormon. Mr. Hulbert makes the following
statement respecting the manuscript which he had in his possession: "..." Now any
one who has read the Book of Mormon, knows that the contents are altogether
dissimilar from this description. [20]

According to Mrs. Davieson’s account, the manuscript was given up to
Hulbert, on the condition that it should be printed, and one half the proceeds
accruing be paid to her. But he afterwards writes to her, that the manuscript
did not read as he expected, and he should not print it. After all, then, it
appears the whole story is traced to the source, which is nothing more than
the ipse dixit of a vagabond, and a fugitive from justice, the veritable D. P.
Hulbert. This is the principal plea which is depended upon for rejecting the
Book of Mormon. Such, then, is the history of the Spaulding lie. It no doubt
has afforded many a pretext for rejecting the truth; but it never prevented a
sincere lover of truth from embracing the message which God has sent again to
the children of men. Why? Because they would search and prove the matter for
themselves, without any regard to what others might do. I now the Book of
Mormon to be true; and all the inventions and slanders which the Devil and his
servants can invent, will never shake my faith in it. The evidence on which it
rests, cannot be overthrown. It will continue to roll on with accelerated
speed; and all opposition, no matter from what source emanating, will be
overcome, and crushed beneath its universal prevalence.
