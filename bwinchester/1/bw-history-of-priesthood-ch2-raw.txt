It appears from what is left on record of the age in which Abraham lived, that the foundation of the heathen mythology was laid, and that a large portion of the world digressed from the path of rectitude and righteousness, and were fast tending forward to that disgraceful confusion and idolatry, that they afterward were thrust into; however, I admit that some few strictly adhered to the principles of righteousness, and that the majority of the nations retained some few vestiges of the pure religion of heaven; as is evident from many things that are recorded in connection with the history of Abraham, and those immediately connected with him. The Lord therefore, foreseeing the result of this apostacy, called Abraham and commanded him to leave the land of his nativity, and go into the land of Canaan.   It seems, that the object the Lord had in view in doing this, was to cause a knowledge of him to be retained on earth, which was likely to be lost among those who had turned to idolatry. In order to accomplish this, the Lord resolved to raise up from Abraham, a choice nation, and peculiar people; -- hence, the Israelites were to be the repositories of his knowledge. As soon as Abraham reached the land of Canaan, the Lord appeared to him and made known in full his intentions, which were as above, and ceded to him and his posterity after him forever and ever, all the land that he could see from an eminent place on which he stood; He also promised him that his progeny should be, comparatively speaking, as numerous as the stars of heaven, and that in and through his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed. All these considerations were included in the covenant the Lord made with him. Now the matter seems to stand thus, the Lord in order to accomplish his purposes, resolved to raise up a people and commit to them his oracles or the holy priesthood, and make them the repositories of his knowledge, and stewards over the affairs of his kingdom. This forms a most exquisite solution of the scriptural doctrine of election and reprobation.The prophets, Christ, and the apostles, unanimously agree that the Israelite nation, were the chosen or elect people of God; or in other words, they were the chosen seed. The idea is, they were elected to hold the office of the priesthood, that all the world might be blessed through their administration; -- for indeed, Christ after the flesh was a descendant of Abraham. In a scriptural sense, the whole Gentile world were reprobated; that is, they were not chosen to hold the office of the priesthood, or to be stewards over the affairs of the kingdom; but this reprobation did not effect their salvation in eternity, provided they were adopted into the family of Abraham or kingdom of God, through obedience to the proper ordinances, administered by those holding the office of the priesthood. Paul, speaking of this chosen people, says: "Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises." * The adoption alluded to here, is already explained in the preceding chapter. -- All the covenants that God ever made with any people respecting priesthood and blessings, are embodied in those made with the house of Israel. The servicealluded to, appears to be that of the priests, while acting in their official capacity, and not the devotional service required of all mankind: for the former was restricted to the Israelites. Christ said: "Salvation is of the Jews." † All the inspired writers, hold forth the idea, that God elected the Israelite nation to be stewards over the affairs of His house or Kingdom, and to hold the office of the priesthood, by virtue of which, all the world could be transplanted into the family of Abraham, and be numbered with the "chosen seed," and sustain an allegiance with God; hence, came the saying; "Salvation is of the Jews." The Lord commanded Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the house of Israel, to circumcise all the males of their families, which was to be as a sign, or token of their relationship with Israel; and that they might be preserved a separate and distinct people by themselves, and not mix with other nations. The covenant made with Abraham concerning the land of Canaan, circumcision, and the multiplication of his posterity, was extra of the covenant of priesthood, which he had received the same as others had before him. The foregoing may be regarded an a slight digression from our subject; but in order to have a correct understanding of the priesthood in this age, it is necessary to have correct information with regard to the object the Lord had in view, in raising up the Israelite nation in the manner in which he did. The first thing, that I shall now introduce as evidence to prove that the priesthood was conferred upon man in this age, is the fact that the gospel was preached in it. Paul says: "And the scripture foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, in thee shall all nations be blessed." * This is conclusive that the gospel was preached to Abraham; but the following is more definite still: "And Melchisedec king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him and said, blessed be Abraham of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth." † The administration of bread and wine as a sacrament, is one of the institutions of the gospel, and was practiced by Christ and his apostles; and no doubt, Melchisedec administered them with the same views, and for the same purpose, that the disciples of Christ did. The profound reverence that Abimeleck king of Gerar, who took Abraham's wife from him supposing she was his sister, had for the Lord, and the principles of virtue and righteousness, is sufficient evidence that he was acquainted with the religion of heaven, and proves to a demonstration, that the law of righteousness; or in other words, the gospel, was understood in his day. Paul expressly says, the gospel was preached to the children of Israel in the wilderness, Eusebius Pamphfus, bishop of Cessrae in Palestine, one of the noted fathers of the church, who flourished in the fourth century, has written in his "Ecclesiastical History," a whole chapter to prove that the gospel of Christ was no new thing; but was preached, not only in the days of Abraham, but long before his day. This is of [undoubted] authority; for Eusebius had a good opportunity to become acquainted with the history of this circumstance. ‡ The foregoing abundantly sustains the idea, that the gospel was preached, understood, and even obeyed, in the age in which Abraham lived; but we will now turn our attention, more particularly, to the priesthood, abstract from other principles. I have before mentioned that Abraham, had the priesthood; and in all probability, he was ordained by Melchisedec: for it is said, that when he returned from the slaughter of the kings, Melchisedec met, and blessed him. -- I suppose Abraham was ordained during this interview. This Melchisedec, who was priest of the most high God and king of Salem, was an extraordinary man in his day; a man of great faith and piety; although, there are some things connected with his history, that are very singular. He no doubt enjoyed all the privileges of the priesthood, and by virtue of the same, reigned as patriarch or king over Salem; and so great was his faith, and fame, that after his day, the priesthood was called after his name. Mr. Joseph Smith explains this as follows: "Why this is called the Melchisedec priesthood, (or priesthood after the order of Melchisedec,) is because Melchisedec was such a great high-priest; before his day it was called the holy priesthood after the order of the Son of God; but out of respect to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, called the priesthood after "Melchisedec," or the "Melchisedec priesthood." There is an apparent contradiction, in the account given by the apostle Paul of this great man: I mean the following: "For Melchisedec king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth of all; first, being by interpretation king of righteousness,(or a righteous king,) and after that also king of Salem, which is king of peace; without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually." * Some have considered the saving, "without father, mother, or descent," sufficient ground for a great many enthusiastic speculations: for instance, that Melchisedec is Christ, or Jehovah; also that he was not a man. But the absurdity of such notions, is seen from the succeeding verses; "Now consider how great this man was, unto whom the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils." "But he [Melchisedec] whose descent is not counted from them [Levites] received tithes of Abraham,.and blessed him that had the promises." From these declarations we discover that this Melchisedec was a man, and had descent; but what does the apostle mean by saying that he was "without father, mother, or descent?" I answer that he did not allude either to the person of Christ or Melchisedec; for each had a father and mother; but to the principle of authority or the holy priesthood, which has existed from all eternity, and has neither father, mother, or descent; and is without beginning in days, or end of life. The apparent contradiction in the apostles phraseology, in all probability, has appeared in consequence of the ignorance of the translator, or some careless transcriber. The apostle holds out the idea, that this priesthood is a kingly one, which appears to be correct, from the fact, that it emanated from God, and He is a King of kings, and Lord of lords; and it is also the authority of his kingdom, and by it, as I have before mentioned, Melchisedec reigned as a king over the inhabitants of the city of Salem. This idea is corroborated by Josephus, who says: "Now the king of Salem met him [Abraham] at a certain place called the Kings' dale, where Melchisedec king of the city of Salem received him. That name signifies the righteous King:and such he was without doubt, insomuch that on this account he was made the priest of God; however, they afterward called SalemJerusalem." * From this we learn that the Melchisedec priesthood, may be with propriety termed, the Righteous kingly priesthood; or to reverse it, a Kingly priesthood or authority adopted to the law of righteousness. It is evident that the only form of government, by which the people were governed in these early times, that met the approbation of the Lord was the Patriarchal. This government, was strictly ecclesiastical, yet it included all the rules and regulations necessary for the well-being of society, and preservation of good morals. The chief ruler was the patriarch, or high-priest, who reigned as king by virtue of the office of the priesthood which he held. Indeed, there are reasons for believing, that all those small kingdoms of the land of Canaan, including those governed by the shepherd kings, were originally only so many branches of the kingdom of God, and each formed a separate organization by itself yet all probably were accountable to a presiding officer, or quorum of officers appointed by the Lord to preside ever the whole kingdom on earth. Melchisedec presided over a church, or branch of the kingdom of this kind, which was at Salem; and in all probability, Abimeleck of Gerar, was a king of this description. All the shepherds kings, and those of Canaan, originally presided by virtue of this priesthood; but as these kingdoms degenerated into apostacy, they incorporated with their religion, many mythological institutions; their government many political, despotic, forms and rules, and each king in time assumed the title of absolute monarch. I infer all this, from some few hints dropped by the sacred historians: for instance, such as the account of Melchisedec reigning as king, in Salem, the profound reverence that Abimeleck had for the Lord, many things connected with the biography of Abraham, the circumstance of Moses finding a priest among the Midianites, who had a knowledge of God, the whole history of, Baalam the prophet, (who in one instance however is called a soothsayer,) and many other allusions to the condition of the nations, with regard to their relationship with God, too numerous to mention. One thing is certain, no people so much deserve the extreme severity of God's judgments, as a set of apostates; and it is evident that these kingdoms had corrupted the holy priesthood, sacrificed to idols, and turned their temples into public brothel houses. They thus provoked the Lord, and kindled the flame of his anger against them, till he sent the Israelites to destroy and dispossess them. This idea of their being apostates, in a great measure, accounts for the severity of his judgments upon them. It also sustains our idea of the object the Lord had in view in raising up the Israelite nation. For proof, that the priesthood existed on earth in the days of Abraham, I refer the reader to the apostle, Paul's epistle to the Hebrews, particularly to the seventh chapter. Moses in his brief account of this age frequently mentions that there were eldersand priests; but some of the modern writers, conjecture they were idolators. This is only supposition and be it as it may, it is evident the authority used in the heathen temples or at their alters was only a corruption of the holy priesthood. God first initiated the offering of sacrifices, (not however to idolatrous gods,) and gave the appropriate names to the various grades or office, and when the nations degenerated into idolatry, they retained these names, and sacrificed to their deities. Moses referring to the circumstance of Joseph buying the land of Egypt, says: "Only the land of the priests bought he not, for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them."It is said, when Jacob died: "And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharoah, theelders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt." It is also said, that Joseph married the daughter of the priest of On. † And when we consider the piety of Joseph his untiring zeal in the cause of righteousness, and avertion to idolatry, we cannot for a moment suppose that such an alliance was made with the daughter of an idolatrous priest; not that Joseph would have polluted his piety by so doing; but the antipathy that existed against each other's religion, would have imposed a barrier in the way. If the foregoing quotations are not positive, I regard them at any rate, as the strongest kind of presumptive evidence, to sustain the before mentioned idea of the priesthood. I cannot consistently close this chapter, without saying something more of what is written in the Book of Job, who in all probability lived in this age. -- What he say's about the "sons of God," sustains our idea that there were many people in this age who had a knowledge of the Lord, and who had received the benefits of the priesthood, and then formed an allegiance with God, and were numbered with his family. The probability is, that this priesthood was conferred by the father upon the son. [From] Abraham to Joseph; moreover it is quite probable, that the twelve sons of Jacob were all priests, for they are regarded as patriarchs. But after the decease of Joseph it seems that idolatry triumphed in Egypt. -- The Israelites were reduced to bondage, and how much they feared God and respected the rules of his kingdom, from this to Moses, is uncertain.
