The location of Zion or the New Jerusalem, is certainly a subject of
importance, and well worth a candid investigation: for it is one that
interested the prophets, and much the more it ought to interest every true
believer of this remote age of the world; for according to the prophets it
will be a place of refuge, and deliverance for the people of God when
destruction comes upon the nations. Again, the Lord not only intends to gather
all his people together in the last days, but he intends to prepare places for
them to gather to. The city of Zion is said to be one of these places of
gathering; therefore, it is of all importance that we should know where it
will be located or established.
</p>

<p>
That there will be a city called Zion or the New Jerusalem, built, beautified,
and prepared for the millennium is evident from all the prophets that have
mentioned the work of God of the last days. We have in a brief manner touched
upon this subject before; but the magnitude and importance of it is such, that
we think that justice to it, requires us to give it a more extensive
investigation.
</p>

<p>
That there was a Zion established at Jerusalem we do not wish to deny; but
that has nothing to do with the one for the millennium. However, because some
are unable to separate, or distinguish it from the one for the Millennium, we
will first show the difference between the two, and then proceed to examine
the prophets with respect to the place of the location of the latter.

This Zion at Jerusalem was sometimes called the upper city, and it was
detached from Jerusalem proper by a wall. Historians say that Jerusalem was
founded by Melchizedek, then called Salem. Paul says Melchizedek was king of
Salem. (See XXSCRIP.) Subsequently it was called Jerusalem; but whether or not
Zion was founded by Melchizedek is not easy for us to determine; but one thing
is certain, it was in existence in the days of David; for when he took
Jerusalem from the Jebusites, it is said that he "..."--XXSCRIP. Many places
in the inspired writings where Zion is mentioned, refer to this Zion at
Jerusalem. XXPROPHET speaking of this Zion says: "..."--XXSCRIP. Now if
XXPROPHET had no idea of any other Zion; than the one at Jerusalem, why did he
use the preposition at, as though there was another city called by the same
name? Indeed, he knew that the Lord would cause to be built another city of
Zion, which should be a place of deliverance in the last days, which he saw in
the vision established upon this land [America]; therefore, he used the
preposition, "..." to designate the difference between it and the one of the
last days upon another land. But says one, if the ancients knew that God would
establish another Zion for the Millennium, why did they call the one at
Jerusalem by that name? This is a thing that the scriptures in a measure leave
in the dark; however, there is a foundation for an opinion, which we will give
whether it is correct or not. Zion is a very ancient name, and signifies the
pure in heart, or the place where the pure in heart dwell; and according to
recent revelations which the Lord has given to his people, there was a Zion
established in the days of XXPROPHET wherein the church of the first-born
dwelt: and perhaps, Paul alludes to this Zion of XXPROPHET when he says:
"..."--XXSCRIP. The saints of the Antediluvian world, are the only ones that
we can with propriety call the church of the first-born; but they and their
Zion are in heaven; and Paul calls their Zion the city of God, and them the
church of the first-born.

Now it is possible that when Melchizedek, or whoever founded Zion; when
arranging the various districts, and suburbs of Jerusalem, called that
district, or the upper city, which was so beautiful and elevated, "..." out of
respect to a former Zion, and because of the pureness of the name; the same as
many name their children after eminent men, and those whom they in a
particular manner respect. After David it was called "..."

When Jerusalem is rebuilt, it is probable that this city of David, will also
be built again; but not in fulfillment of the predictions of the prophets
concerning the establishment of the latter-day Zion or the New Jerusalem; but
in fulfillment of prophecy relating to the rebuilding of Jerusalem: for when
it is built of course all its districts and suburbs will also be built. But we
have said enough upon this part of the subject, and we hope that the reader
will be able to designate the difference between the Zion which was at
Jerusalem, and the one that the Lord shall cause to be built for the saints to
gather to, and be a place of refuge and deliverance at the time that God will
trouble the nations with his wrath.
</p>

<p>
This Zion of the last days, we believe will be located on the land of America;
and indeed, the prophets have said enough to establish this idea. David says:
"..." "..."--XXSCRIP. David evidently saw the situation of Zion, which he says
is beautiful, at some other place besides Jerusalem, or he would not have said
that it was on the sides of the North. Match this saying with what XXPROPHET
says in the xviii,∗ of his prophecy, concerning a land [America] beyond the
rivers of Ethiopia, and we learn: first, as XXPROPHET says, that this is the
land where the Lord’s ensign of the last days was to be reared, and from
whence the ambassadors of the Lord are to be sent to all nations, and where
"..." shall be established, to which the servants of God, or swift messengers
to the nations shall bring a present unto the Lord of a people terrible from
their beginning. This proves that Zion is to be located in America. Second,
that, according to David, it is to be on the sides of the North; consequently,
on North America. David says in another place: "..." "..."--XXSCRIP. It cannot
be said in truth that Jerusalem was in the fields of the wood in David’s
time; therefore, we conclude that he had reference to some other place besides
Jerusalem. Indeed, the interior of North America is interspersed with the
fields of the woods, or in other words fields in the midst of the wilderness.
XXPROPHET says: "..."

∗ We have before entered into a full investigation of this chapter;
therefore, we do not deem it necessary to make any more comment upon it. (See
page 182.)
</p>

<p>
We have before proved the XXBOOKOFMORMON to be true; therefore, whatever it
says upon this subject we consider as valid testimony. XXPROPHET writing the
words of XXPROPHET says, page 550. "..."

As we have before mentioned the prophets have declared that there shall be
deliverance for the saints in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem; therefore, when we
take all things into consideration, we discover that it is perfectly
consistent with reason and the scriptures, for Zion to be built upon this
continent: for this is a promised land to the tribe of Joseph, as much so as
Canaan to the House of Israel. For instance, the Lord will establish a place
of gathering upon this land, near the center of the North division of the
continent, which will be convenient for the House of Joseph that is upon this
land to gather to, and also, for many of the saints that are now scattered
among the Gentile nations. And also he will cause the old city of Jerusalem to
be rebuilt, and the Jews to gather there. Thus there will be two central
places of gathering, and deliverance. Zion, and Jerusalem, when spoken of as
being the two great places of deliverance, are not synonymous: for Jerusalem
and its suburbs when spoken of at a distance are all ranked under the one
head; but the prophets speak of Zion as being established, and having stakes,
or auxiliary cities. The city of David or Zion at Jerusalem was merely an
auxiliary and not the principal. XXPROPHET places this matter beyond doubt,
that Zion and Jerusalem are not synonymous; but on two separate lands. "..."
It is said, XXSCRIP, that in the days of Peleg the earth (not nations) was
divided; it is also said, XXSCRIP, that the waters were gathered together unto
one place at the time of the creation; and of course the land was in one
place; but it is manifest that there has been a great division, so much so
that the earth has been divided into continents, which the bible says was done
in the days of Peleg; but according to the prophet XXPROPHET, when the time of
restoration comes, then this continent upon which Zion shall be built, shall
re-unite with the eastern, and thus fulfill the saying, "..." or Joined. But
says the objector, how can there be two places of gathering if XXPROPHET’s
words are true? "..." We have before proved that the land of America is a
promised land to the House of Joseph; therefore, the "..." are here as much so
as in the land of Canaan. The idea is that the whole earth will be subjected
to one form of government, and to one code of laws, and one king shall rule
over them whether in America or in Asia. But the two continents are to be
united, and then it will be an easy thing for them to become one nation upon
the mountains (not mountain) of Israel, and at the same time the tribe of
Joseph and others dwell in Zion, and its vicinity upon this land, and the Jews
in the land of Canaan, and one king rule over them all.

Having dropped the foregoing hints upon the location of the Zion for the
Millennium, to aid the reader to designate the difference between the Zion at
Jerusalem, and the one of the Latter-days:--we will now quote a few of the
sayings of the prophets concerning the utility of this Zion, the materials of
which it shall be built, its glory, and magnificence, etc., etc., and let that
suffice for the present.
