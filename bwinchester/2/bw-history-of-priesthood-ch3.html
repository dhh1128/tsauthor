<p>
It is mentioned in the preceding chapter, that the Lord chose or elected, and
raised up the Israelite nation, to receive His oracles, and to be stewards
over the affairs of His kingdom; but I will now introduce, from the
scriptures, some additional evidence of sustain the idea. Moses, in his
address to the house of Israel just previous to his death, says: And because
He loved thy fathers, therefore He chose their seed after them, and brought
thee out of his sight, with his mighty power out of Egypt. * "..." † Isaiah
says: "..." Stephen the martyr, said in his discourse to the Jews: "..." *
</p>

<p>
I regard these quotations as conclusive testimony, to establish the above
idea; but there is much more that is satisfactory to corroborate it in the
apostle Paul's "..." which the reader can examine at leisure.
</p>

<p>
Now I trust that I have adduced sufficient evidence to convince every candid
person, that the Lord established His kingdom with the house of Israel, and of
course that He gave them the priesthood; but to what extent they enjoyed the
rights and privileges of this kingdom, and its authority, will be seen
hereafter. -- But to proceed with my history.
</p>

<p>
It is evident the Israelites in a measure corrupted the priesthood while they
were in Egypt; and that they were to a certain extent enveloped in a spiritual
darkness at the time the Lord delivered them from their oppression. The manner
in which they were delivered, is familiar to almost everybody; therefore, I
shall omit the particulars of it, in order to immediately proceed with the
subject matter of my history.
</p>

<p>
Moses, after he had slain the Egyptian, fled to the land of Midian where he
became acquainted with Jethro, a priest of the Midianites, with whom he
resided forty years, and ultimately married his daughter. The Midianites are
supposed by some to have been sons and daughters of Abraham, from the fact he
had a son by his wife Keturah, whom he called Midian. This perhaps will
account for the continuation of the priesthood down to Jethro.
</p>

<p>
This association with this priest of Midian, afforded Moses a good opportunity
to become acquainted with all the blessings and privileges of the holy
priesthood: and in all probability Jethro consecrated him to the office of it.
At the expiration of those forty years, the Lord or his angel appeared to him,
and instructed him to go to Egypt, and lead the tribes of Israel from thence
to the land of Canaan. He complied, with this command, and the Lord sent Aaron
to assist him, and they in due time succeeded in leading the chosen people of
the Lord out of Egypt.
</p>

<p>
After they had crossed the Red Sea, Jethro hearing of the prosperity of Moses,
and the children of Israel, set out to pay him a visit: and as soon he reached
the place of his destination, and Moses had related all the circumstances
connected with their deliverance and journey to him, he then gave Moses such
advice as he thought was good: which was to organize the congregation of
Israel, by appointing rulers or judges of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties,
etc., which counsel he cheerfully received, and acted accordingly. Some
suppose this Jethro, was an idolatrous priest, which is certainly a great
absurdity, for this reason. It is said, that when he came to Moses, he "..."
and that he "..." and spoke in the highest terms of His greatness and majesty.
It is also said, he offered sacrifices to God upon the altar that Moses had
built, and that Aaron, and all the elders of Israel, associated with, and
cordially received him. All of this, does not look much like the work of an
idolatrous priest. -- What would we think of a Christian society, that would
admit an idolatrous priest into their church to preach, advise, and administer
ordinances? I leave the reader to answer this question. But says one, perhaps
Moses, out of courtesy, suffered him to do this, because he was his
father-in-law. I reply, that it is quite probable Moses had as much respect,
if not more, for the Lord and the principles of righteousness, as he would
have for an idolatrous priest, although he was his father-in-law. Indeed, I am
confident that no intelligent person, can carefully read the eighteenth
chapter of the "..." without being convinced that Jethro was a righteous man
and a notable priest of the most high God. 'Thus admitting, the Israelites
corrupted the priesthood while they were in Egypt, we have discovered the
probable way it was restored to then. Again, it is abundantly evident, that
the gospel was preached to them, and the kingdom of God organized among them.
The apostle Paul says: "..." * Again the apostle says: "..." With all the
ingenuity I have, I cannot interpret this in any way, other than that the
house of Israel were baptized in the Red Sea, by Moses and others whom he had
commisioned for that purpose; and were overshadowed or baptized with the
Spirit of God which appeared, and rested down upon them like a cloud. But says
one, were they not baptized in the sea when they crossed it? I answer that it
is said, they passed through the sea dry-shod, or as on dry ground; and the
idea, of baptizing people in the sea on dry ground, would be a novel thing in
the bible indeed. The idea is, they were baptized unto Moses, the same as the
Jews were baptized unto John the Baptist in Jordan. Moses like John, set forth
or proclaimed the doctrine of baptism, and baptized those who believed, or
authorized some other one to do it. Some of the most approved historians,
admit the ordinance of baptism was practiced long before the commencement of
the Christian era, which I have no reason to dispute; but I contend that it
was an ordinance of the gospel then, as well as now.
</p>

<p>
I regard the foregoing passages of scripture, as positive evidence, that the
gospel was preached, and the ordinance of baptism administered, to the
children of Israel in the wilderness. But it appears, they were a stubborn and
wicked race of people, and often complained of the Lord, and rebelled against
Moses. For this reason, the Lord gave them one of the most despotic laws, that
ever human beings were made subject to. The apostle Peter said, it was a "..."
Paul says, "..." he also says, "..." Added to what? not to a system of heathen
mythology, nor to the law of Egypt, neither to that of any other nation. But I
am certain the gospel was preached unto them, and I know of nothing else to
which this ceremonial law could have been added. The idea, that it was added
in consequence of transgressions, is sufficient evidence that it was intended
as a curse, or punishment for their stubbornness. Again it appears, that it
was appended to the gospel, to continue only until Christ should come and
abolish it.
</p>

<p>
I have now arrived at the place, where I can introduce the Aaronic, or lower
order of priesthood, which I have before said, was only an appendage; or in
other words, only a part of this grand principle of authority. Why I call it
the lower order is because that it is not the fulness of the Priesthood, or
authority to perform the works of God. I mean by this, that those who are made
priests after the order of Melchisedec, enjoy all the rights, and privileges
of this authority; but those who are made priests after the order of Aaron,
only possess a part; yet all that their grade of office guarantees to them:
hence, the Aaronic, or Levitical priesthood, is only a branch of the
Melchisedec: and is called the Aaronic, because it was conferred upon Aaron,
and his sons, to continue hereditary throughout their generations; and it was
their place as bishops or priests, to preside over all the different grades of
officers, that came under their jurisdiction: and it was called the Levitical,
because the men of the tribe of Levi, were chosen to administer in all the
various offices of this priesthood, instead of all the first-born of the
tribes of Israel.
</p>

<p>
Some suppose, this lower order of priesthood had a beginning with Aaron; but
the inconsistency of such an idea, is exposed by placing it in conjunction
with the following Scripture: "..." * The Lord did not command Moses to induct
Aaron into a new order of priesthood just instituted; but speaks as though it
was of long standing, and well understood by all. But to be brief, -- I infer
from the above, and many other like sayings written in the bible, † that
this order of priesthood is but a branch, or one of the departments of the
Melchisedec, and is of equal antiquity. Although I admit that the giving of
the law is regarded as a new dispensation, yet by no means does the idea
imply, the institution of a new priesthood.
</p>

<p>
But during the existence of the Mosaic ritual, it was confined to Aaron's
progeny, and the tribe of Levi, and in particular appropriated to the service,
and performance of the ceremonies, and institutions of this law.
</p>

<p>
That the grade of office, which Aaron held, was inferior to that which Moses
held, is evident from the following: "..."
</p>

<p>
* Thus Moses had a privilege to converse with the Lord face to face; but
Aaron, and other prophets that were then in Israel, were not entitled to this
prerogative.
</p>

<p>
There are some things connected with the account of the personal appearance of
the Lord to the patriarchs, and prophets, that are very singular and strange,
yet sublime, and consistent with good reason. It is said, that the Lord
appeared to Abraham, and dined with Him; but it is evident, He did not appear
in His glory: for when Abraham saw him, and the angels with him, he thought
they were three men. It is also recorded, that Jacob wrestled with the Lord,
and conversed with him face to face. Moses and the seventy elders of Israel at
one time, saw the Lord; but there appears to be some difference in the manner
in which these elders saw him, and that in which, Moses did at another time.
All the congregation of Israel saw the cloud, and heard the voice of the Lord
from it; but did not see him, and talk with him face to face as a man talketh
with his friend, as Moses did. But there is an apparent contradiction in the
terms employed in recording this matter, which needs some explanation: Moses
made this request of the Lord. "..." He was answered thus; "..." This answer,
is understood or explained, by the request made. -- Now when Moses came down
from the mountain, the glory of the Lord shone on or from his face, so much
so, that the children of Israel could not look upon him; therefore, he covered
it with a veil: so no doubt the glory of the Lord is in His countenance or
shines from His face; therefore, the idea the Lord conveyed to Moses was, that
no man in his common state of this life can see His glory, that is, the full
extent of it, and live. The account that follows this answer of the Lord to
Moses, corroborates my explanation: "..." * Christ, and the apostles,
seemingly contradict the idea of any man seeing God, even in the manner
Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and others did. Moses and other historians explain
these accounts by relating the manner in which the Lord appeared to these man;
but when Christ and the apostles say, "..." they speak of Him, as He exists,
in the full sense of the word; that is, they include all His glory, and
majesty: for in this sense no man has seen God; in other words, the fullness
of His glory: for it seems to be reserved to be shown at some future period.
But one of the observations of Christ, in my opinion, serves as a key to
unlock the whole of this mystery: "..." † It is probable Christ here alluded
to himself; but the same rule may be with propriety applied to others, such an
Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Melchisedec, Jacob, Moses, and others, who were
priests of the same order that He was o£ and indeed, all were priests of the
most high God; but the mission assigned to these men, differed from the one
allotted to Christ. In a word, all these great and holy men, or noted priests
after the order of Melchisedec, were only so many members of the grand cabinet
of the Great God, and were endowed with plenipotentiary power or authority;
and of course, had the right to converse with Him face to face and of
receiving information from Him, to communicate to the subjects of the kingdom.
</p>

<p>
The following is satisfactory evidence, that Moses was a great high-priest
after the order of Melchisedec: "..." (Moses.) Peter said the prophet alluded
to here, is Christ: and the apostle Paul says, He is a priest forever after
the order of Melchisedec: hence, as He was to be like Moses; Moses must have
been like Him in possession of the same priesthood. This is corroborated by
David, who says, Moses was a priest of God.
</p>

<p>
Moses by the authority of this priesthood presided over the house of Israel,
and was their law-giver; and was blessed with the privilege of conversing with
God face to face, and even to see him; but Aaron, and his sons, received an
inferior office; therefore, they did not see God as Moses did; neither did
they converse with him face to face; but received information from Him by
means of the Urim and Thummim, through the agency of angels, by visions, and
by the Spirit of God. But it appears, in consequence of the wickedness of the
children of Israel, Moses was taken from them, and no one was ordained to
succeed him and hold the same office. Joshua succeeded him as a leader, and
judge in Israel; but did not hold so high an office in the kingdom of God. The
Lord commanded Moses thus: "..." * This expression, "..." shows that Moses
ordained him to an office inferior to the one he held himself. And it will be
remembered, those who have received the fulness of the priesthood, have a
right to officiate in, and ordain others to all inferior ranks of office.
Joshua was certainly a very eminent man, and had great faith, yet he was not a
high-priest of the Melchisedec order like Moses. Furthermore, it will be seen
from what I have before said, that when the Lord took Moses from the children
of Israel, he left them no other priesthood, but the Aaronic.
</p>

<p>
Moses says, it was the intention of the Lord, to make the house of Israel a
kingdom of priests; but it appears, that in consequence of their wickedness,
this never was as yet fully accomplished; but will be when they are restored
to their former inheritance, and the kingdom given to them again. Yet during
the elapse of time, from Moses to Christ, it appears, they were the only
people, who had the priesthood, or in any respect possessed the kingdom of
God, and all who desired to be partakers of its blessings, were under the
necessity of being adopted into the family of Israel.
</p>

<p>
The sons of Aaron, were hereditary heirs of this inferior order of priesthood;
for the Lord gave it to them with a covenant; or in other words, he made a
covenant with Aaron, that it should, on condition of faithfulness, continue
with him and his posterity forever.
</p>

<p>
The form of government instituted for Israel, was ecclesiastical, and as far
as their authority extended, it was patriarchal: the sons of Aaron as bishops,
(or high-priests of this inferior order of priesthood,) presided over the
spiritual affairs, and all the Levitical priests officiated under their
direction; they also had judges to oversee their temporal, or political
affairs, and to legislate for them; but more or less under, the direction of
the presiding priest, who obtained the word of the Lord by means of the Urim
and Thummim. Josephus says, this instrument was a transparent or shining
stone, which was consecrated to the Lord and placed in Aaron's breastplate,
and that somehow by its shining, or reflections, he obtained the word of the
Lord; but he says, it ceased to shine about one hundred and fifty years before
Christ. *
</p>

<p>
It is quite probable; that several of the Jewish prophets, by their faith
received the Melchisedec priesthood from God, or an angel sent to confer it
upon them. It is evident, that Samuel, David, Solomon, Elijah, Isaiah and
others, received it, for some of them offered sacrifices; but they having
received the highest order of priesthood, had a right to officiate in all the
lower offices of it. This accounts for these men officiating at the altar, who
were not of the tribe of Levi.
</p>

<p>
In process of time, the Israelites became corrupt in their notions, and
desired to have a king like other nations, which displeased the Lord; however,
He granted their request. From this to the appearance of Christ, they had
their blessings, and their afflictions: at times they were faithful to God, at
others they turned to idolatry, and the Lord suffered them to be brought into
bondage, and pressed with heavy afflictions. But at no time, did they consider
themselves under a more severe curse, than when they were scattered or driven
from their land; for this simple reason, they knew how to appreciate the
privilege of living a separate people by themselves, where they could worship
God under their own vine and fig-tree unmolested.
