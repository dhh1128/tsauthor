<p>
THE ORIGIN OF THE SPAULDING STORY, CONCERNING THE MANUSCRIPT FOUND; WITH A
SHORT BIOGRAPHY OF XXTITLEANDNAME, THE ORIGINATOR OF THE SAME; AND SOME
TESTIMONY ADDUCED SHOWING IT TO BE A SHEER FABRICATION, SO FAR AS ITS
CONNECTION WITH THE XXBOOKOFMORMON IS CONCERNED.
</p>

<p>
THE following work is not designed as a vindication of the peculiar tenets of
XXCHURCHFULL--but simply as an exposition of the means used, by the enemy of
all righteousness, to stop the progress of inquiry, and prejudice the minds of
those who know little or nothing of the religious faith of those who believe
the XXBOOKOFMORMON an inspired record of a fallen people; and thereby prevent
examination and investigation. The writer has therefore esteemed it a duty
devolving on him, to make a statement of facts coming under his own
inspection; as well as those with which he has had ample opportunity of
becoming cognizant.
</p>

<p>
THE ORIGIN OF THE SPAULDING STORY CONCERNING THE MANUSCRIPT FOUND.
</p>

<p>
As the public mind has been somewhat agitated for the last nine or ten years,
upon the subject of Mormonism, (so called,) and as there have been coined and
put in circulation, innumerable statements respecting its origin, and all of
them contrary the one to the other; I deem it an act of justice to a belied
people, and a deceived public, knowing the facts of the case, to present them
to the truth of the matter, and to know the contradictions and absurdities,
which are swallowed greedily down, without question or examination, because
men love darkness rather than light.
</p>

<p>
THE Spaulding tale of a ‘manuscript found,’ seems to be the basis, from
which the vast multitude of ephemeral lies derive their very existence. I
shall, therefore, address myself to the task of its entire demolition, so far
as it has any thing to do with the XXBOOKOFMORMON; when the superstructure
reared thereon, will fall to the ground of necessity.
</p>

<p>
I shall, in the first place, relate a few of the incidents that brought me in
connexion with XXCHURCHFULL; and in the next, give a short biography of
XXTITLEANDNAME, who first originated the above tale; and thirdly, compare his
testimony, with that of others of his coadjutors; and I think that the sequel
will clearly disclose it to be a base fabrication, as notorious as that
invented eighteen hundred years ago;--"..."
</p>

<p>
In the month of November, 1832, I, for the first time, had the privilege of
attending a meeting which was addressed by an elder of the church to which I
now belong. I then resided in Erie Co., Pa. I was much prejudiced, and
supposed them to be among the greatest of impostors, and their doctrine to be
a delusion of the worst kind, I had imbibed these opinions from newspapers,
and public rumour, which represented them as holding all things common, being
seditious, and denouncing the bible, and being led on by a set of men devoid
of every moral principle, and ripe for any enormity. The better to secure
their hellish purposes, they had invented a new code of morals, embodied in
the golden bible.
</p>

<p>
With these by no means favourable prepossessions, I was curious to hear these
distinguished emissaries of his satanic majesty, as I verily supposed them to
be. After entering the house where the meeting was appointed, I beheld a young
man in the act of commencing the services, by reading a chapter in the new
testament; this somewhat astonished me. He addressed the people on the subject
of the gospel of Christ; and seemed only solicitous to impress upon his
hearers, the necessity of obeying the gospel. And instead of learning some new
fangled doctrine, as I expected, contrary to that taught by the Saviour and
his apostles, I heard the very doctrine Christ commanded his disciples to go
and preach; and the very words the apostles used, enforced upon his hearers;
he insisted upon the absolute necessity of obeying all the commandments of
God; and showed what the first principles of the doctrine of Christ, as taught
by the apostles were, as follows: 1st, To believe in God, and in Jesus Christ
his son, and that the only plan of saving men, is through the gospel, see
XXSCRIP;--2nd, Repent of, and forsake you sins; 3, Baptism for the remission
of sins, see XXSCRIP;--4th, the laying on of hands for the reception of the
Holy Ghost. This he demonstrated to be a commandment of the Lord, and an
ordinance of the gospel, as much as any other contained in the new testament,
by the following passages: XXSCRIP,--xix, 6,--XXSCRIP. He also contended that
the children of men take the new testament for their rule of faith and
practice, in the present age of the world, as in any other; and that the
church of Jesus Christ be organized on the plan therein directed, see XXSCRIP.
12th chap.; Ephesians, 4th chap.
</p>

<p>
I immediately recognized this as the doctrine of the Bible, and that there is
no such thing as believing the Bible and denying the doctrines contained
therein. Indeed it commended itself to my conscience in the sight of God.
</p>

<p>
The next meeting he held, the congregation was addressed on the coming forth
of the XXBOOKOFMORMON. This was a new and a strange thing brought to the ears
of this generation. The eyes of the people, however, were opened to understand
the scriptures, which testify of the work of the Lord in the last days, and
the manner of its accomplishment. The visions of the prophets were unfolded,
and many of their declarations shown to be fulfilling before our eyes. The
subject assumed a majesty and glory, which altogether surprised and captivated
the audience; and we discovered that the stone cut out of the mountain without
hands, and which should ultimately fill the whole earth, had already began to
roll. That God had indeed chosen the foolish things of this world to confound
the wise, and the weak things to confound the mighty. Other appointments to
preach were made in other places, in the appointments to preach were made in
other places, in the neighbourhood; and the same commotion which the ancient
gospel produced, was found still to accompany its promulgation. Some received
the truth in the love of it, others used every exertion to withstand it. After
I had heard several discourses on the fulness of the gospel, I felt anxious to
ally myself to a people who were every where spoken against, and sought the
earliest opportunity of doing it; accordingly, I went forward and was
baptised. This was in the month of January, 1833; shortly after this, quite a
number, seventy or eighty, were baptised and added to the church.
</p>

<p>
Thus mightily grew the work of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit was poured out.
Other elders began to visit us from other parts of the United States. This
brought me acquainted with many of them, among them appeared the famous
XXTITLEANDNAME, some of whose writings I shall examine. He was at this time,
April, 1833, an elder. The numbers of the church having increased, and the
desire to hear considerable, in the surrounding country, it was thought best
for him to remain and fill the calls. XXTITLEANDNAME resided at Jamestown,
N.Y., previous to his embracing the profession of a Latter Day Saint, and was
a member of the Methodist E. Church, and was for some time a class leader, and
then an exhorter and local preacher; but was expelled for unvirtuous conduct
with a young lady; at length he embraced the faith of the church of XXLDS, and
soon started for Kirtland, Ohio; ostensibly to cultivate an acquaintance with
the brethren there. On his way, he passed through the place in which I
resided; he was not ordained at this time; while at Kirtland he was ordained
to the office of elder, and shortly returned to Pennsylvania, and commenced
preaching as before mentioned. The members of the church at this time had
confidence in him as a man of God; but this was soon shaken by his conduct.
XXTITLEANDNAME was a man of some parts, and evidently from his conduct and
bearing, fully conscious of his power, and while conversing with the other
elders or more humble character and acquirements, he often exhibited the
spirit of big I and little u.
</p>

<p>
While in this region of country, he made several converts in Crawford county,
Pa. He frequently called, and stayed over night at my father’s; which
afforded me an opportunity of forming a correct estimate of the man. The
church ultimately lost their confidence in him, in consequence of the
discovery, that the organ of amativeness, philoprogenitiveness, or some other
organ, not of a moral mould, was unduly developed, and that the gratification
of these propensities manifested itself in numerous peccadillos, disgraceful
to the man, and calculated to bring upon him the reproach of every lover of
virtue and correct morals; so much so, that he was cast off from the church,
and his license taken from him by the conference; at first he appeared
impenitent and obdurate, but afterwards professed penitence and humility; he
soon left for Kirtland, to appeal to the general conference, when his case was
reheard, and, in consequence of confession and acknowledgement, his license
was restored. In returning into Pennsylvania, he stopped at Thompson, Geauga
county, Ohio, and immediately commenced his old practices, in attempting to
seduce a young female, but Providence interposing, frustrated his diabolical
designs. For this crime he was immediately expelled from the church, and his
license called for, but he refused to give it up. On discovering he had
irretrieveably ruined himself with the church, his tactics were changed, and
he now determined to demolish, as far as practicable, what he had once
endeavoured to build up. Now his nefarious purposes were frustrated, he sought
to obtain revenge in this manner. Not because he did not conscientiously
believe the work of God, as proclaimed by the XXLDS, but because he had rather
enjoy the pleasures of sin, which are but for a season. And now he could no
longer hide himself under the cloak of religion, and have a name with the
people of God, because his wickedness was brought to light, and proclaimed as
on the house top.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, he determined like a true son of the old Apostate, to take a firm
stand against God and his truth. He accordingly repaired to Springfield, Pa.;
in which place he held forth for the first time. From that place he came to
the neighbourhood where I resided. I would here observe, that while he was in
connexion with the church of XXLDS, the preachers and priests of the different
denominations heaped their calumny upon the Society for fellowshipping him;
and made a stumbling block of him, and said there was no mark of a christian
about him. But no sooner had he made his appearance as the campion of
sectarianism, and the assailant of Mormonism, than churches, chapels, and
meeting-houses were crowded to hear him. By this time the doctrine of Jesus
Christ had been proclaimed there about six months. The priests and people had
been engaged, with all their powers, to suppress the work; their exertions,
however, were fruitless, and the work of the Lord continued to roll on in
majesty and power; truth triumphed, and the number of the disciples was
greatly multiplied. In this condition of things, the sudden appearance of
XXTITLEANDNAME among them, afforded an opportunity for the Devil to rally his
forces once more, and renew his attack; their zeal was again renewed, and
their hopes reinvigorated, and the cry was down with Mormonism.
</p>

<p>
I attended the first lecture that was delivered in the neighbourhood, and
there I beheld priest and people listening with breathless anxiety, to see and
hear Mormonism forever demolished, and utterly overthrown, with as much
interest, apparently, as the Pharisees waited the decision of Pilate, on the
death of Jesus Christ. I say, with so great avidity did they drink in the
falsehoods, misrepresentations, and calumnies of this modern Julian. The
inebriate shout, and the ribald jest, evinced, in a manner not to be mistaken,
how welcome the work which he was performing, was to his hearers: there were
men, who had never been to hear a single discourse by our people, exclaiming,
how true he does it, "..." Those who had been engaged in overthrowing the
cause of God, were inspirited to fresh effort, and renewed hope of succeeding
in obtaining a signal victory, and that its promulgators would flee the
country in disgrace.
</p>

<p>
The now XXTITLEANDNAME was petted and patronised by priest and people, and
every accommodation afforded him. After spending two or three months in that
region of the country, lecturing, it was quite manifest to him that his plan
had completely failed to secure his purposes. He resolved, therefore, to try a
new experiment, and that was to forge a lie, and make it look as plausible as
possible.
</p>

<p>
After having pursued the history of this individual so far, we shall now
proceed to detail the precise manner in which the Spaulding story originated,
respecting the manuscript found, which, it is supposed by some, has been
transmuted in to the XXBOOKOFMORMON.
</p>

<p>
In doing this, I shall be led to notice the proceedings of the fabricator of
the same, while engaged in maturing his infamous project.
</p>

<p>
During the six or eight months that XXTITLEANDNAME was preaching in the State
of Pennsylvania, (part of the time he belonged to the church, and part of it
he was lecturing against it;) he formed a large circle of acquaintance, and
mingled with all sorts and classes of people. While in a small village, called
the Jackson settlement, (a place that is famous for infidels,) he became
familiar with a family of the name of Jackson, and others, who were personally
acquainted with the now celebrated Solomon Spaulding, who is reputed to be the
legitimate author of the XXBOOKOFMORMON. Here, while in conversation with
them, XXTITLEANDNAME learned that XXTITLEANDNAME, while alive, wrote a work
called the Manuscript Found. Not that any of these persons had the most
distant idea that this novel had ever been converted into the XXBOOKOFMORMON;
or that there was any connexion between them. Indeed, XXTITLEANDNAME, who had
read both the XXBOOKOFMORMON, and Spaulding’s manuscript, told
XXTITLEANDNAME when he came to get his signature to a writing, testifying to
the probability that XXTITLEANDNAME’s manuscript had been converted into the
XXBOOKOFMORMON; that there was no agreement between them; for, said he,
XXTITLEANDNAME’s manuscript was a very small work, in the form of a novel,
saying not one word about the children of Israel, but professed to give an
account of a race of people who originated form the Romans, which
XXTITLEANDNAME said he had translated from a Latin parchment that he had
found. The XXBOOKOFMORMON, he added, purports to be written by a branch of the
house of Israel; is written in a different style, and altogether different;
for this reason XXTITLEANDNAME refused to lend his name to the lie, and
expressed his indignation and contempt at the base and wicked project to
deceive the public.
</p>

<p>
XXTITLEANDNAME was a disinterested man, and a good citizen.
</p>

<p>
XXTITLEANDNAME, after learning that such a novel had been written, in order to
carry out his designs, resolved to make the fact, that a novel had been
written, the foundation of a notorious fabrication; and at the same time make
it appear as plausible as possible, to deceive the world, and induce them to
account for the origin of the XXBOOKOFMORMON in some other way than the truth.
</p>

<p>
After XXTITLEANDNAME had learned what I have before mentioned, he immediately
repaired to Kirtland, Ohio, and made an appointment to deliver a lecture, on
what he called Anti- Mormonism; and made a special request that all who were
opposed to the church of XXLDS should attend, which they did, both priest and
people, and composed a council, which I suppose resembled strongly the
conclave of Hell, or the Jewish Sanhedrin, when they met to put down Jesus and
his doctrine.
</p>

<p>
Here XXTITLEANDNAME had ample opportunity to display his talent for talking,
to a people who listened with breathless attention, and were greedy in
devouring his words, expecting to hear some great secret divulged.
XXTITLEANDNAME told them that he had been travelling in the State of
Pennsylvania, lecturing against Mormonism; and that he had learned that one
XXTITLEANDNAME had written a romance, and the probability was, that it had, by
some means, fallen into the hands of Sidney Rigdon, and that he had converted
it into the XXBOOKOFMORMON. XXTITLEANDNAME stated also, that he intended to
write a book, called Mormonism Unveiled, which he said would divulge the whole
secret.
</p>

<p>
His auditors were much elated at the idea, and one of the a Campbellite, by
name, Newel, and a notorious mobocrat in the bargain, advanced the sum of
three hundred dollars, for the prosecution of the work; others of them
contributed for the same purpose, and expressed their desire for it to be
hastened as fast as possible. After receiving such encouragement, he proceeded
immediately to prosecute his hellish purposes with more courage than ever, and
was immediately fitted out, and started in search of the above manuscript. He
proceeded as far as New Salem, the place where XXTITLEANDNAME lived, when he
wrote his manuscript found; and called a meeting, and made known his
intentions. This meeting caused considerable stir in the place, and was
attended by a number of the citizens. XXTITLEANDNAME mentioned to them that he
had learned that one XXTITLEANDNAME, several years since, had written a novel,
while living in that place, and the probabilitywas, that S. Rigdon had by some
means obtained it, and converted it into the XXBOOKOFMORMON. This idea was new
to them, however, they were pleased with it, and XXTITLEANDNAME’s project
seemed to them a good one; XXTITLEANDNAME therefore received their support in
the shape of some money, and was advised to visit XXTITLEANDNAME’s widow,
now XXTITLEANDNAME, who resided in Monson, Mass.; and learn if possible all
the particulars concerning the matter. I ought to mention that the doctrine of
Jesus Christ, had been propagated with considerable success, in the region
round New Salem; and had caused there as it every where does, no small stir
among the people. And the enemies of truth, had there exhausted all their
ingenuity, to put a stop to the progress of righteousness; but still the
number of the disciples was daily multiplied. The Spaulding story was never
dreamed of, till XXTITLEANDNAME mentioned it, notwithstanding this was said to
be the identical place where the thing was written. But to my history.
</p>

<p>
XXTITLEANDNAME immediately repaired to Monson, Mass., to see XXTITLEANDNAME,
who, after XXTITLEANDNAME presented his object, gave him the writings of her
former husband; (this, XXTITLEANDNAME says himself, in Mormonism unveiled, and
also in priest Storrs’ history of the origin of Momonism,) and told him
there was a trunk somewhere in the state of New York, which also contained
some papers which he might have if they were found to suit his purpose;
XXTITLEANDNAME says, he found nothing in this trunk that would suit his
purpose.
</p>

<p>
By the way, while XXTITLEANDNAME was on his way to Mass., he called at
Palmyra, N. Y., and some of the adjoining towns, and obtained the signatures
of several men, bitter and declared enemies of Joseph Smith, Jun., testifying
many hard things concerning him, which has exalted his character very much in
the estimation of every disinterested person, from the fact, that it is an
honour a man to be slandered by a set of blackguards, liars, horse jockeys,
and drunkards; but to proceed, XXTITLEANDNAME while in conversation with
XXTITLEANDNAME, learned that XXTITLEANDNAME removed from New Salem to
Pittsburgh, Pa., in the year 1812; and in a short time after, to Amity,
Washington Co. Pa. and deceased in the year 1816; this information was thought
to help along the project admirably, and no sooner had XXTITLEANDNAME returned
to New Salem, than it was thought best, that he should immediately repair to
Pittsburgh, and XXTITLEANDNAME’s manuscript had ever been left there. Now
the whole aim and object of this project, was to make the public believe, that
Sidney Rigdon was the real author of the XXBOOKOFMORMON. It is a fact easily
apprehended, that if a man or set of men, undertake to palm an abominable lie
upon the public, they will endeavour to make it as plausible as possible.
Therefore, knowing that S. Rigdon had resided in Pittsburgh for a certain
length of time, he had endeavoured to make the finding of the manuscript take
place at Pittsburgh, and then infer, that S. R. had coppied it there.
</p>

<p>
After XXTITLEANDNAME returned from Pittsburgh, he went to Kirtland, Ohio, and
stopped in that region of country, as he said, to learn other particulars, and
finish writing his book. XXTITLEANDNAME had not been there long before he
threatened to murder Joseph Smith, Jun., for which he was bound over in the
sum of five hundred dollars, to keep the peace. While there, his best friend
began to lose confidence in him, his reputation waned rapidly, and the dark
side of his character began to develope itself more fully, and he began to
play his old pranks.
</p>

<p>
Those who were anxious that XXTITLEANDNAME’s work should come out discovered
it would not do to publish it in his name, his reputation was too rotten; they
advised him therefore, to sell it to XXTITLEANDNAME, of Painesville, Ohio, for
five hundred dollars. XXTITLEANDNAME got the money, and gave up his
manuscript, thus Mormonism Unveiled, became the adopted offspring of
XXTITLEANDNAME; indeed Hulbert’s name was cancelled in many places. These
are facts, and can be proven by hundreds of unimpeachable witnesses in that
region of country.
</p>

<p>
XXTITLEANDNAME with his ill gotten gains, went to Erie county, Pa., in the
township of Girard, Miller Settlement, and bought a farm, and married a wife,
soon became a confirmed drunkard, spent every cent of his inglorious gain, was
reduced to beggary, took to stealing for a livelihood, was detected in
stealing a log chain, fled the country, to esc1ape justice, and that is the
last of him, so far as I know. I have written this short biography of
XXTITLEANDNAME, that my readers may know the character of the man who first
invented the Spaulding lie.--Also that they may know the merit of him whom the
priests of this day, to serve their purpose, have dubbed honourable, reverend,
etc.
</p>

<p>
As respects "..." published by E. D. Howe--its circulation in the west was
trifling. They knew too much about it; the persons by whom, and the way in
which it was got up. Therefore it died a natural death, in a very little
while; and, instead of XXTITLEANDNAME making a fortune by it, as he expected,
the edition became a burden to him. He offered them at less than half price,
and could not get rid of them even then. Instead of doing harm to the church
of XXLDS, it did good, for this reason: there had been as much noise made
about it as if a mountain were in labour, and when the delivery came, behold
it was a mouse. It was boldly affirmed that Mormonism was to receive its death
blow: when the blow came, there was no force in it. Vague conjecture,
improbabilities, and abuse, were the ingredients of which it was made.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the downfall of "..." and the complete prostration of this
scheme of the Devil and his emissaries in the West, a new version of the thing
has been published by the religious editors of New York, who have asserted its
incontrovertible truth; and by their positive affirmation, succeeded in
deceiving some with an exploded lie, acknowledged as such in the section of
country where it was begotten.
</p>

<p>
Still another version has made its appearance, emanating form one
XXTITLEANDNAME, a Congregationalist priest, of Holliston, Mass., which has
come before the world in a different form--in fact they completely annihilate
each other. Last of all, it has been re-dressed , and re- touched, in some of
the papers of this city, in a manner likely to deceive some, who are
unacquainted with the facts; and it is on this account particularly, that I
have undertaken the present statement of facts.
</p>

<p>
I will now proceed to examine them specifically--compare them with each other,
and expose thereby their positive falsehood, by the contradictions which they
contain.
</p>

<p>
First, of Priest Storrs’ version of the story, purporting to be signed by
Matilda Davieson, the relict of Solomon Spaulding.
</p>

<p>
This immaculate gentleman commences by remarking, "..." Does the reverend
falsifier know, that the XXLDS esteem the Scriptures so highly, that they
denounce the whole sectarian world as apostates, on the ground that they have
so lightly prized them, as to renounce a certain part thereof, by saying they
are non-essential? Answer, Yes, assuredly.
</p>

<p>
It is next asserted, that XXTITLEANDNAME removed from New Salem to Pittsburgh,
Pa. Here XXTITLEANDNAME found an acquaintance and friend in the person of
XXTITLEANDNAME, an editor of a newspaper. He exhibited his manuscript to
XXTITLEANDNAME, who was very much pleased with itand borrowed it for perusal.
</p>

<p>
Now, if XXTITLEANDNAME’s testimony can be relied on, this statement is
false; for, as soon as it appeared in public, XXTITLEANDNAME called on
XXTITLEANDNAME, to know if this statement was true. XXTITLEANDNAME replied,
that he knew nothing of any such manuscript. I learned this from
XXTITLEANDNAME’s own mouth, who is a man of undoubted veracity. I suppose
the pious priest of Holliston was labouring under the hallucination of
trusting to his cloth to cover his naked fabrication. A very rotten
dependence, truly! XXTITLEANDNAME states, that he called on XXTITLEANDNAME,
who affirmed his entire ignorance of the whole matter. The author of "..." and
"..." are clearly at work unwittingly destroying each other.
</p>

<p>
(Dr. is not the title of his profession, he being the seventh son, his mother
saw proper to name him doctor.)
</p>

<p>
Again, it is asserted, that "..." Sidney Rigdon was never connected with any
such office, for the simple reason, that no such office was in existence while
XXTITLEANDNAME resided in Pittsburgh! XXTITLEANDNAME kept a book and
stationary establishment at that time, and had no connection whatever with
XXTITLEANDNAME. The author of the "..." has therefore been guilty of forging,
inventing, or circulating a demonstrative falsehood; and however he may
attempt to screen himself under his sanctimoniousness, the covering cannot
hide him. The horns and the hoof will betray, in spite of himself, and exhibit
the folly of the concealed culprit. "..."
</p>

<p>
But again. "..." The intention of the whole scheme is manifestly to create the
impression that S. Rigdon had a share in its production, if he was not the
sole author of the XXBOOKOFMORMON. Almighty God always does his work so as
effectually to preclude the possibility of its ever being mistaken for the
work of man, by the lover of truth; and the attempt of the father of lies to
make a show of accounting for the XXBOOKOFMORMON, in some other way than the
truth, will not deceive a single honest heart, whose motto is, "..."
</p>

<p>
That XXTITLEANDNAME lived in Pittsburgh between the years 1822 and 1826, no
one disputes; but that he had any thing to do with the compilation of the
XXBOOKOFMORMON, we utterly deny. In fact, he did not know of its existence
until years after, as we are prepared to show. Let us, however, see how the
statements tally. XXTITLEANDNAME wrote his manuscript in New Salem, Ohio, in
the year 1812: from thence he removed to Pittsburgh. Here the ingenious author
carefully conceals the time when he removed to Pittsburgh. Why? Because he
would be building his fabric with one hand, and pulling it about his ears with
the other. XXTITLEANDNAME says the widow of XXTITLEANDNAME informed him, that
the removal to Pittsburgh took place in 1812, and from thence to Amity, in
1814. XXTITLEANDNAME is made to say in the "..." that, "..."
</p>

<p>
Admitting this--all the time, and the only time S. Rigdon had an opportunity,
or possibility, of becoming acquainted with the manuscript, was between 1812
and 1814; for since that time, it has been carefully kept by XXTITLEANDNAME.
S. Rigdon is now forty-seven years of age--consequently was born in 1793; and
in 1812, of course, was only nineteen years of age. I learned from his mother,
before the Spaulding story was ever thought of, that he lived at home, and
worked on the farm, until the twenty-sixth year of his age, and was never
engaged in public life until after this period, either politically or
religiously. Any one who can credit that a plough boy, nineteen or twenty
years of age, who had lived a secluded life from his infancy, could set to
work to copy a manuscript necessary for a book of six hundred pages, and
secrete it twenty years, without the slightest apparent reason under heaven,
can find no difficulty in believing Mahomet’s account of the seventeenth
heaven. Mark, XXTITLEANDNAME says she had it form 1814 to the time of
XXTITLEANDNAME’s application, in her own possession: couple that with the
fact, that S. Rigdon never lived in Pittsburgh until after 1822!
</p>

<p>
eight or ten years after the manuscript was in the careful preservation of
XXTITLEANDNAME!! The very lame attempt at something like precision, by
affixing names and dates, is then the key by which the whole plot is
unravelled and exploded. Another extract from the "..." is as follows: "..."
As I lived close by New Salem at this time, I knew all the Elders of this
church who visited New Salem. I have reason to know that no such meeting as
that herein described ever took place; especially as we never had a female
teacher in the church! We do not allow any such impropriety. This account
moreover says, that John Spaulding, brother of Solomon, was present at this
meeting, and "..."
</p>

<p>
In the first place, XXTITLEANDNAME S. does not live in New Salem, or in the
state! And in the next, it is a very strange thing that a saint of God should
be engaged in manufacturing a Romance, (lies!) to palm upon the public as
truth: surprising consistency!! We will match this with an extract from
XXTITLEANDNAME. "..." neither does their witness agree together, and it is
clear whose servants they are, because his works they do. XXTITLEANDNAME is
said to be deputed by some others to visit Mass., to obtain from
XXTITLEANDNAME the original manuscript; we have examined this more
particularly in the former part of our remarks; priest Storrs evidently
borrowed this idea from the veracious gentleman himself.
</p>

<p>
The far famed manuscript, it is said, was delivered up to Hulbert, by
XXTITLEANDNAME, and that is the last of it. Where is it now? Why has it not
been published long ago? Simply because it would have branded their statements
with everlasting infamy. It is certainly of sufficient moment to warrant a
publication, and the interest these gentlemen have taken in the matter,
proves, beyond all doubt, that they consider it so. Will these pious and
patriotic citizens not lend a hand to undeceive some hundreds of thousands of
human beings, in an affair of such intrinsic importance, when it can be done
with such ease, and withal so effectually. With all their pretension to
christian philanthropy, what is the position they now occupy; according to
their own showing, multitudes have, and are continually receiving a book as of
divine origin, and moulding their faith and practice therefrom, when these men
start up and declare we have discovered it is all a gross imposition! it was
written by a man for amusement! we have the identical manuscript from which it
was copied; and yet refuse to bring it to light! Do not these men stand
convicted in every honourable mind, with being either recreant to their duty,
as teachers of religion, or wilfully blinding and deceiving the people. One of
these must be true, and we think there is no difficulty in determining which,
when it is remembered how zealous these men have been in using every means in
their power to withstand the progress of truth.

. . . Having said so much respecting the manuscript found, I shall add a few
more remarks, and then close the subject. Sufficient has already been said to
prove clearly to every candid mind, that the whole story is not reconcilable
with the facts, as stated by the originators themselves, and by its various
contradictions completely destroys itself, and proves it to be a base
fabrication.

It is evident, from Hulbert’s own statement, that he obtained the manuscript
from XXTITLEANDNAME; but, after comparing it with the XXBOOKOFMORMON, he found
there was no correspondence or similarity between them, either in style or
contents: therefore, to cover his own shame, he resorts to the supposition,
without a particle of presumptive evidence, that S.

Spaulding had written a different kind of novel, and the probability was, that
it had been converted into the XXBOOKOFMORMON. XXTITLEANDNAME makes the
following statement respecting the manuscript which he had in his possession:
"..." Now any one who has read the XXBOOKOFMORMON, knows that the contents are
altogether dissimilar from this description.

<p>
According to XXTITLEANDNAME’s account, the manuscript was given up to
Hulbert, on the condition that it should be printed, and one half the proceeds
accruing be paid to her. But he afterwards writes to her, that the manuscript
did not read as he expected, and he should not print it. After all, then, it
appears the whole story is traced to the source, which is nothing more than
the ipse dixit of a vagabond, and a fugitive from justice, the veritable D. P.
Hulbert. This is the principal plea which is depended upon for rejecting the
XXBOOKOFMORMON. Such, then, is the history of the Spaulding lie. It no doubt
has afforded many a pretext for rejecting the truth; but it never prevented a
sincere lover of truth from embracing the message which God has sent again to
the children of men. Why? Because they would search and prove the matter for
themselves, without any regard to what others might do. I now the
XXBOOKOFMORMON to be true; and all the inventions and slanders which the Devil
and his servants can invent, will never shake my faith in it. The evidence on
which it rests, cannot be overthrown. It will continue to roll on with
accelerated speed; and all opposition, no matter from what source emanating,
will be overcome, and crushed beneath its universal prevalence.
