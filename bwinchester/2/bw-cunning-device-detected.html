<p>
It will be recollected that a few months since an article appeared in several
of the papers, purporting to give an account of the origin of the
XXBOOKOFMORMON. How far the writer of that piece has effected his purposes, or
what his purposes were, in pursuing the course he has, I shall not attempt to
say at this time, but I shall call upon every candid man to judge in this
matter for himself; I shall content myself by presenting before the public the
other side of the question, in the letter which follows.
</p>

<p>
You see by the above questions and answers, that XXTITLEANDNAME in his great
zeal to destroy the XXLDS, has asked XXTITLEANDNAME a few questions, and then
wrote a letter to XXTITLEANDNAME in his own language. I do not say, that the
above questions and answers were given in the form that I have written them,
but these are the substance of the questions asked, and the answers given.
XXTITLEANDNAME is about seventy years of age, and somewhat broke.

<p>
It may be proper to furnish the reader with an extract from XXFIRSTNAME
XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME’s answer to XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME’s "..." which will
prove beyond all question, unless his testimony with the others concerned is
proven false, that XXFIRSTNAME XXLASTNAME never saw the XXBOOKOFMORMON, till
some time after its publication.
</p>

<p>
"..."
</p>

<p>
Having said so much respecting the manuscript found, I shall add a few more
remarks, and then close the subject. Sufficient has already been said to prove
clearly to every candid mind, that the whole story is not reconcilable with
the facts, as stated by the originators themselves, and by its various
contradictions completely destroys itself and proves it to be a base
fabrication.
</p>

<p>
It is evident, from XXLASTNAME’s own statement, that he obtained the
manuscript from XXTITLEANDNAME; but, after comparing it with the
XXBOOKOFMORMON, he found there was no correspondence or similarity between
them, either in style or contents: therefore, to cover his own shame, he
resorts to the supposition, without a particle of presumptive evidence, that
XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME had written a different kind of novel, and the
probability was, that it had been converted into the XXBOOKOFMORMON.
XXTITLEANDNAME makes the following statement respecting the manuscript which
he had in his possession: "..." Now any one who has read the XXBOOKOFMORMON,
knows that the contents are altogether dissimilar from this description.
</p>

<p>
According to XXTITLEANDNAME’s account, the manuscript was given up to
XXLASTNAME, on the condition that it should be printed, and one half of the
proceeds accruing be paid to her. But he afterwards writes to her, that the
manuscript did not read as he expected, and he should not print it. After all,
then, it appears the whole story is traced to the source, which is nothing
more than the ipse dixit of a vagabond, and a fugitive from justice, the
veritable XXINITIAL XXLASTNAME. This is the principal plea which is depended
upon for rejecting the XXBOOKOFMORMON. Such, then, is the history of the
XXLASTNAME lie. It no doubt has afforded many a pretext for rejecting the
truth; but it never prevented a sincere lover of truth from embracing the
message which God has sent again to the children of men. Why? Because they
would search and prove the matter for themselves without any regard to what
others might do. I know the XXBOOKOFMORMON to be true; and all the inventions
and slanders which the Devil and his servants can invent, will never shake my
faith in it. The evidence on which it rests, cannot be overthrown. It will
continue to roll on with accelerated speed; and all opposition, no matter from
what source emanating, will be overcome, and crushed beneath its universal
prevalence.
