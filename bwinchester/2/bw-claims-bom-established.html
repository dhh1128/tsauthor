These with the following, are the effects that this book was to produce: "..."
According to the above, it was to be but a little while after the book came
forth, before the terrible one [Satan] should be brought to naught. He is not
yet brought to naught; therefore, the appearing of the book was a work of as
late a date as the nineteenth century. The house of Jacob shall not now be
ashamed, or in other words they will be brought to a knowledge of the truth,
and no more be degraded, cast off, or made ashamed, because of their
transgressions. This corresponds with what XXPROPHET says about Israel after
the two sticks were to come together. "..." etc. Since the appearance of the
XXBOOKOFMORMON many thousands that were blinded by sectarian doctrines, and
erred in spirit, have been made to rejoice in God: for they have come to a
correct understanding of the principles of righteousness. But says one, what
is the use of this book, admitting it is true?--We answer, first, it brings to
light an important history before unknown to man; second, it reveals the
origin of the American Indians; third, it contains important prophecies, yet
to be fulfilled, which immediately concern this generation; fourth, it
contains much plainness in regard to points of doctrine, inasmuch that all may
understand, and see eye to eye, if they take the pains to read it; fifth, it
helps to fill the measure of the knowledge of God, that it may cover the earth
as the waters cover the sea.

<p>
Now reader, we have said much about the tribe of Ephraim, and that the
XXBOOKOFMORMON, to use XXPROPHET’s words, is the "..." and it is plain from
the prophets that the Lord has chosen the tribes of Ephraim, and Judah, to be
instruments in his hands to perform great works. Christ was of Judah, and the
apostles were chiefly of the same tribe. They have performed their work,
namely, preached the gospel to the nations of the earth, and written much by
inspiration;--but God has sent forth some of the writings of the tribe of
Ephraim, or Joseph, and he will yet make instruments of them to gather Israel;
and help prepare the way for the Millenium: therefore, it is reasonable for us
to look for their writings: for, according to XXPROPHET they were to have an
abundance of them; speaking of the Ephraimites, he says: "..."--XXSCRIP. David
says by the word of the Lord: "..."--XXSCRIP. XXPROPHET says: "..."--XXSCRIP.
Now the children of Joseph, or Ephraim never have been the instruments in the
hands of God to gather in the people from the ends of the earth; but according
to the above they will yet do it. XXPROPHET is very plain on this subject:
"..."--XXSCRIP. First it is said, in the above that the watchmen of Ephraim
shall cry to the people, saying, "..." second, it is said that the children of
Israel shall be restored; third, when they are restored, Ephraim shall be the
Lord’s first-born. Ephraim was the second son of Joseph, and Joseph was the
eleventh son of Jacob; therefore, this birth has reference to the Ephraimites,
first of all the tribes receiving the gospel--being born of God. Therefore, it
is perfectly consistent with reason, for their writings to come forth to
assist in this work of gathering.
</p>

<p>
XXPROPHET connects the following with this work: "..." "..."--XXSCRIP.
XXPROPHET speaking of their restoration, and the everlasting covenant that the
Lord will make with them, says: "..."--XXSCRIP. Now we ask, can any one tell
whether the American Indians are of Israel unless by revelation from God? This
was a hidden mystery, which was necessary to be revealed in time for their
gathering.--But enough is already said upon this part of the subject.--There
is an abundance of collateral evidence in favor of this work, such, as the
predictions of the prophets concerning the ensign that God will rear for the
gathering of Israel; "..." etc., which we shall hereafter notice under another
head.

<p>
HISTORY OF THE ANCIENTS OF AMERICA, AND ALSO OF THE XXBOOKOFMORMON.
</p>

<p>
SIX hundred years B. C., according to the XXBOOKOFMORMON, XXPROPHET, who was a
righteous man, was fore-warned of the destruction of Jerusalem and the
Babylonish captivity, who was commanded by the Lord, took his family and fled
into the wilderness. He pitched his tent in the wilderness near the Red Sea,
and sent back his sons to Jerusalem, who persuaded one Ishmael and his family
to accompany them to their father XXPROPHET. The Lord promised to lead them to
a choice land above all lands; therefore they set out on their journey for
this land. After a long and tedious journey, they came to the great waters, or
the Ocean. XXPROPHET the son of XXPROPHET, who was also a prophet, and their
pilot, or leader in the wilderness; was commanded and instructed to build a
ship sufficiently large to transport them over the sea. This work was
accomplished in eight years from the time they left Jerusalem. They set sail,
and in a proper time they landed, as we infer from their record, somewhere on
the Western coast of South America. They immediately commenced tilling the
earth, and erecting mansions for dwelling places.
</p>

<p>
XXPROPHET had six sons, Laman, Lemuel, XXPROPHET, Sam, Jacob, and Joseph.
Laman, Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael rebelled against God, and would not
keep his commandments: for this they were cursed. Their posterity in process
of time became a powerful nation; but extremely wicked, and their chief
occupations were hunting, plundering, and roving about from place to place. In
the XXBOOKOFMORMON they are called Lamanites. The other sons ef XXPROPHET were
obedient to the commands of God. Their posterity also in the course of time
became a great nation, and were called Nephites. To them God committed his
divine oracles, (the holy priesthood) and they had prophets and inspired men
among them. They also kept a record of their prophecies, and revelations, and
the proceedings of their nation. When they left Jerusalem they brought with
them the law of XXPROPHET, and the writings of the former prophets, down to
the days of XXPROPHET. This accounts for the quotations from XXPROPHET and
others, which are found in the XXBOOKOFMORMON.
</p>

<p>
The Nephites tilled the land, built cities, and erected temples for places of
worship; but the Lamanites lived a more indolent life; although, in some
instances they built cities. The Nephites were at times faithful to God, at
other times they were indifferent, and would not be faithful. They frequently
had long and tedious wars with the Lamanites, and were often driven before
them. They were constantly emigrating to the North. At length they commenced
settlements in the region of country, not far from the Isthmus of Darien, and
while in those parts they advanced farther in science and arts, than at any
time previous; and built more spacious cities, and buildings than they did
before.
</p>

<p>
Six hundred and thirty odd years from the time XXPROPHET left Jerusalem,
Christ, after his resurrection, appeared unto many of the Nephites and
established his church, chose disciples and sent them throughout the land to
preach his gospel, thus fulfilling the saying: "..."
</p>

<p>
Individuals of the Lamanites at times were obedient to the faith. The Nephites
after Christ’s appearance were faithful for many years; but in the third or
fourth century iniquity began to abound, and their love began to wax cold.
Some dissented and raised up churches for the sake of gain; and thus they were
troubled with the spirit of pride and haughtiness. God commanded Mormon, who
lived in the fourth century, to preach repentance to them, and foretell their
destruction if they would not repent. The Lord foreseeing that they would not
repent, commanded Mormon to collect the writings of his forefathers--their
revelations and prophecies, etc., and make an abridgment of them, and engrave
them upon new plates, (their manner of keeping records was to engrave them on
metallic plates.) But in consequence of their wars, and their flight to the
North, to escape the Lamanites, he did not live to finish this work; and when
the final destruction of the Nephites drew near, he gave the records to his
son XXPROPHET, who lived to see their final extermination, or destruction by
the hands of the Lamanites, and they with his father left to moulder on the
plain.
</p>

<p>
Thus a powerful nation, whose fathers were the favorites of heaven, were cut
off, and their names have faded into oblivion. Oh! sin thou foul monster! Thou
art terrible, thy ways are death! why didst thou cause such a nation to be
blotted out of the earth?
</p>

<p>
The Indians of America are the descendants of the Lamanites, and according to
predictions that are in the XXBOOKOFMORMON, they will yet lay down their
weapons of war and be converted unto the Lord.
</p>

<p>
XXPROPHET finished compiling and abridging the records of his fathers, which
he engraved upon new plates, for that purpose, to use his own words, as
follows: "..."
</p>

<p>
He also engraved on them an account, called the "..." of a people who left the
Old world, and came to this continent, at the time the language was confounded
at Babel; which was a partial fulfilment of the saying: "..."--XXSCRIP. If any
person should wish to learn further concerning this people, let him read the
XXBOOKOFMORMON.
</p>

<p>
XXPROPHET was then commanded to deposite this record in the earth, together
with the Urim and Thummim, or as the Nephites would have said, Interpreters,
which were instruments to assist in the work of the translation, with a
promise form the Lord that it should be brought to light by means of a Gentile
Nation that should possess the land; and be published to the world, and go
forth to the Lamanites, and be one of the instruments in the hands of God for
their conversion. It remained safe in the place where it was deposited, till
it was brought to light by the administration of angels, and translated by the
gift, and power of God. But says one, who ever heard of such a thing as a
record being deposited in the earth? We answer: that it is nothing more
strange than it was for XXPROPHET to hide the tabernacle, and the ark of the
covenant, which contained the tables of stone, written upon by the finger of
God, Aaron’s rod, and the pot of manna, in mount Nebo. This account is to be
found in the Apocrypha of the Old Testament; 2nd Book of Maccabees, ii
chapter. But says the objector, perhaps the account is not true? We answer:
that history corroborates it. This record was not designed to be a source of
wealth, or wordly profit to any one; but to be deposited again, because they
were sacred, as much so, as the tables of stone, on which the ten commandments
were written. However they were shown to chosen witnesses, men of undoubted
veracity, who testify that they saw it, and know by the voice of an angel that
it is the work of God. But says the objector, again, why was it not shown to
the world, and then there would have been no doubt about this matter? We
answer: first, because God commanded otherwise, which is the best of all
reasons; second, the same may be said about the tables of stone; why did not
XXPROPHET show them to all the children of Israel? We have no account of his
showing them to but a few; but on the contrary they were placed in the Holy of
Holy where the High-priest was only allowed to enter once a year. Third, why
did not Christ show himself to the Jews after his resurrection, and thus
convince them that he was the true Messiah? Peter said: "..."--XXSCRIP. Thus
the world had to believe the resurrection of Christ from the testimony of
interested witnesses, and not from disiniterested. What men often think to be
the best way, God generally looks upon as foolishness. We will here insert the
testimony of three witnesses, which is appended to the XXBOOKOFMORMON; page
572, third edition. . . . . . .
</p>

<p>
Now reader the above is as positive a testimony as there ever was concerning
any truth that God ever revealed since the world began, and the knowledge that
enabled them to testify, professes to have come from heaven: therefore, if it
is deception, there is no other way to find it out, but to receive
intelligence from whence it professes to have come. It is affirmed to be true,
from the testimony of an angel, and a million negatives will not make it
false, or effect its truth in the least. There was a few individuals that
testified to the resurrection of Christ from an actual knowledge--they had
seen him; but there were many nations that denied, and said, he had not rise
from the dead; but what did it all amount to? He came from heaven, and the
only way for them to know whether he did or not, was to get a revelation.
XXPROPHET testified of the flood, and for all that we know, all the
Antediluvians took the negative side of the question; but what did it all
amount to? XXPROPHET obtained his knowledge from heaven, and condemned the
whole world by his testimony; and yet they had as many reasons for rejecting
him, as the people have for rejecting the XXBOOKOFMORMON. XXPROPHET alone
testified of the flood; but there are thousands that can testify that the
XXBOOKOFMORMON is true. If the XXBOOKOFMORMON is the work of wicked men, it
cannot be found out in any other way but by revelation; therefore, those who
oppose it, that have received no revelation, do not know whether they are
fighting against God, or the Devil. Thus the XXBOOKOFMORMON is supported by
that kind of evidence, that all the divines, priests, and professors, cannot
overthrow it. It bears its own weight: for it is true, and none can make it
false. Indeed, if there was no other evidence in favor of it, but the
testimony of the three witnesses which we have inserted, we should consider
ourselves under obligation to believe it, until a testimony is received from
heaven to over-balance that which is in favor, which professes to have come
from heaven. Others may think as they please. But says one, the characters of
some of the founders of the sect are such that we have reason to believe that
it is all a fabrication. We know of nothing that is derogatory to their
characters, but the foul misrepresentations of priests, professors, and
editors. The professors of religion circulated falsehoods about Christ, and
the apostles; but all did not make Christ a false prophet. A thousand
falsehoods are in circulation about the XXBOOKOFMORMON, and those who were the
instruments in the hands of God to bring about this work and what do they all
prove? If they prove any thing, they prove that they are men of God, and that
the XXBOOKOFMORMON is true. Christ said: "..." "..." "..." Again, why were not
these things revealed to some of the learned divines, instead of XXFIRSTNAME
XXLASTNAME? Answer: why did not Christ choose for his apostles some of the
High-priests of the Pharisees, or some of the doctors of the law, instead of
fishermen. "..."
</p>

<p>
There is also the testimony of eight other witnesses, who testify that they
saw this record. Their testimony is to be found on the last page of the
XXBOOKOFMORMON.--We will now extract a few prophecies from the XXBOOKOFMORMON.
