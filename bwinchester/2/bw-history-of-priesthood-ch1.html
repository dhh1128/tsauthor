SENTIMENTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH DISTINGUISH THE ABOVE SOCIETY FROM OTHERS

___________

THE subject of the Holy Priesthood, is one of magnitude and immense moment
to every biblical student, especially those who belong to the society of which
the author of the following work is a member, and one that diffuses new light
over the whole face of the sacred volume. It enables the inquirer after truth
to understand the manner in which God always has, and ever will, deal with the
human family.

There is no important topic in the oracles of divine truth, that stands
independent of this institution. To a certain extent it is the principle by
which the Lord works among men, and is the channel through which all the
spiritual gifts, such as miracles, revelations, visions, etc., flow or are
obtained; and is also, the authority by which individuals are legally inducted
into the kingdom of God. This kingdom or church, is organized and maintained
by it: for it is the power of God conferred upon His people; but when it ceases
to exist on earth, the church falls into darkness, and ultimately degenerates
into apostacy; hence, comes division, misrule, countless tomes of controversy
about doctrine, and all the mysticisms, that now characterize the religious
world.

The subjects of the redemption of man, the mission and divinity of Christ, the
precepts of the gospel, the true order of the kingdom of God, the gifts and
blessings guaranteed to the citizens of this kingdom, the renewal of the
gospel dispensation, the XXBOOKOFMORMON, the restoration of the house of
Israel to the lands of their fathers, Zion for the Millennium, the second
advent of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and Millennium, are
inseparably connected with the Priesthood, all of which are discoursed upon,
and set forth in their true light in the course of this work.

However the merits or demerits of the work, are not for the author to
determine; but for the public, to whom it is now cheerfully submitted for
perusal.

The earnest solicitation of numerous friends to publish a work of this
description, and an ardent desire to propagate the truth, are the principal
causes that induced the author to mature it into its present form; therefore,
it is hoped that it will produce the desired effect, which is, to be the means
of doing much good; or in other words, to effectually subserve the cause of
Christ.

A TRAIN of events having rendered my circumstances such, that I cannot at
present be constantly engaged in the field labour, sounding the trumpet of the
everlasting gospel, or of decanting upon the beauties of holiness, with the
view of elucidating the riches and splendor of the kingdom of God: but being
inspired with feelings of respect, and ardent desire for the welfare of my
fellow man: and knowing that I cannot employ my time in a more serviceable
way, than when I engage myself in making plain to the understanding the
matchless work of God, I have retired from the hum of business, and chatting
of social society, to while away a few hours of solitude, in deep reflection
upon the high-toned economy of God, or self-commending plan of Salvation,
which I deem prudent to publish for the consideration of the honest inquirer
after truth.

The subject that occupies its place as one of the departments of the economy
of God, that I have made choice of, as will be seen from the Title, to fit
within the narrow limits of this little volume, is the Holy Priesthood, the
history of which I intend to give, with the view of the rise and establishment
of the kingdom of God of the latter-days, and fulfilment of the numerous
promises of God to his people.

Come Heav'nly Spirit I invoke thy aid,

O'respread me with thy cheering influence;

Touch the intellect, help the mind to soar

Above the narrow works of boasting men.

What is in me dark, illumine; O guide

The immortal part, sacred in the path

Of truth, that things past, present, and to come,

May be with great precision unfolded.

'Midst the labyrinth of the dark ages,

Of times or trial of struggling mortals,

Of which no history is conclusive,

Assist the mind untrammel'd to traverse

'Midst monuments survived the wreck of time,

Of truth unchang'd, unsullied, ever bright,

Though like lonely stars that in chaos shine,

While darkness, and confusion reigns around.

High Heav'n lend thine influence, act the part

Of the magic star of Bethlehem, that

Guided the guard'an shepherds of the east,

To the place where Immanuel was laid:

So inspire my mental pow'rs, direct my

Mind, a wise and just selection to make,

Of gems of 'lasting truth; and thus to rear

The temple of argument, in defence

Of the cause, nay more th' rights of Israel's God.

Once more kind Heav'n, thine influence I ask,

That like a well instructed scribe, I may

In wisdom, bring forth things both old and new;

That this work, the force of my exertion,

May prove a sure guide to eternal bliss.

Considering the foregoing a sufficient introduction, I now invite the reader
to divest himself of all unfriendly prejudice, and participate with me in the
investigation of our subject; but before we begin our research, let us have a
fair understanding with regard to the meaning of this holy priesthood; a
knowledge of which we are in search of.

When I speak of the holy priesthood, I mean to be understood as speaking of a
delegation from God, or a legation from heaven, which is in authority
conferred upon individuals authorizing them to act in the name of the Lord, or
to administering ordinances and transact such business as appertains to the
kingdom of God; or in other words, the Lord does a part of His work by proxy,
or employs righteous men as His agents, and his priesthood is the commission
or power given to them; however, the reader is not to understand from this,
that the priesthood is wholly restricted to this world; but to the contrary,
it is a principle congenial with the works of God, and binds the hosts of
heaven together, and authorizes the angels to act in the name of God
throughout the boundless realms of light; and (as will be seen hereafter,) no
one has a legal right to administer in the name of the Lord without this
authority.

The sacred writers have ascribed to this priesthood, two departments, or
general heads; the one they denominated the Melchisedec the other the
Aaronic or XXSCRIP the latter seems only to have been an appendage to
the former, as I shall endeavor to make appear in its proper place. Having now
given my views with regard to the import and object of the priesthood, I renew
the invitation to the reader, to join me in this research, which we will now
commence.

Moses says: "..." (and all
things upon it.) "..." Thus we are to infer, that as the earth rolled from the hands
of its Maker, every thing was pure. Nothing molested the quiet of all the
Lord's holy mountain; all the beasts of the forest were docile or harmless.
But the most noble of all His works, was the formation of man in His own image
and likeness, whom He located in the beautiful garden of Eden or earthly
paradise; and gave him power to have dominion over all things upon the earth.
Thus Adam was made governor over all the works of God upon this planet, which
then formed a province in the vast kingdom of worlds, or boundless creation of
God. In this condition, he not only occupied the place of a ruler, but he
formed a connection between the heavenly intelligences, and other animate
creatures that dwell upon the earth.

But let us for one moment, further contemplate the state of things at this
period: -- The earth was (and is yet) the Lord's, And all things upon it: for
he created them. -- Adam, accompanied, by his companion, was located in the
capital, of it, to all appearance, with a prospect of enjoying a world of
pleasure. The earth was the extent of his dominion, yet all were under the
jurisdiction of the Lord.

Under, these circumstances, Adam having authority to sway his sceptre over the
whole province of the earth, it was only necessary that he should be
restricted under certain rules or a law, for the well-being of the whole of
the lower creation. This being the case, the welfare of all things upon earth,
to a certain extent, depended upon the conduct of man. The relationship that
Adam sustained with the Lord, was that of a son, if we credit the testimony of
St. Luke. * But alas! man only held this blissful station while in obedience
to the Supreme Head of all things; and in disobedience the whole scenery was
changed, and tinged with a crimsoned woe, sorrow, and perplexity. -- Satan,
who in all probability is a fallen angel, employed the serpent or disguised
himself, and thus beguiled Eve, who took and gave to Adam, and thus they both
partook of the fatal fruit, which was peremptorily forbidden. The penalty of
the law was inflicted, which was banishment from the beautiful garden and from
the presence of God, also temporal death. Thus Satan took the character of an
invader, and invaded the earth: the earthly paradise became lost to man, and
his relationship with God was broken; hence, since the fall, all mankind,
before obedience to the law of redemption, are foreigners, aliens, and
strangers to God. Under these circumstances, Adam, before having a knowledge
of the plan of salvation, must have been in an awful condition: -- A veil of
obscurity now intervened between him, and his God; the angels, who were
formerly his companions, did not so frequently visit him; the ground was
cursed, and became parched and obdurate, so that it required much manual labor
to obtain vegetation sufficient for his sustenance. The beasts of the forest
begin to tear each other in pieces; the more harmless birds of the wood,
hastened to some place to screen themselves from the more ravenous kind. Alas!
the harmony that once existed, was broken up, and a woeful confusion reigned
in its steed, and a horror and awful dread of death pervaded the mind of Adam,
and racked his soul with fearful anxiety respecting his future fate. Thus with
a prospect of lingering out a wretched existence, in a state of banishment
from the presence of God, and with awful feelings, as though they were the
horrible forebodings of perpetual despair, he no doubt, bewailed his
condition.

Now under consideration that these were the circumstances of man at this
period, and that satan had invaded the earth; I ask, what was there to be
done? Man had lost this earthly paradise or pleasant estate; the infliction of
the penalty of the law, which he had broken, rendered him an alien from God
and this curse was to be entailed upon his posterity. Could he without any
permission from heaven, establish a law or order of things, by which he could
regain that which he had lost? I answer in the negative. Again, would it have
been consistent with the character and mercy of the Deity, to have forever
abandoned him to wretchedness and woe, without offering him a chance to
return? I opine not. Still, I interrogate, would it be consistent with the
rules of propriety, for an alien to assume the authority to administer the
forms of the law, and thus adopt himself as a citizen of a distant kingdom, or
for two foreigners to commission each other to do a thing of the kind? Every
intelligent person will respond in the negative. Again I repeat, what should
be done? I will answer this by referring to what has been done.

After the Great God, condescended to alleviate the painful condition of man,
by promising that in His own due time He would send his Son who should be
offered as a sacrifice for the original sin, and redeem all mankind from the
consequences of the same. He also proffered to him the law of redemption; or
in other words the plan of Salvation, through obedience to which, all the
human family can form and sustain an allegiance with God. It would seem from
the scriptures, that this law of redemption is the law of the kingdom of God,
given to the faithful for their special benefit; but it is absolutely
necessary for all to be obedient to it, in order for them to become citizens
of this kingdom. But the point now at issue is, how the human family were to
come in possession of this kingdom: they certainly could not usurp it, neither
could they form this allegiance with God without a permit from heaven
authorizing them so to do.

Again, there was no way for God to establish his kingdom among foreigners,
unless he appeared in person and done it, or sent an embassy for that purpose.
An assumption on the part of the foreigners, would not answer. Thus it
appears, that there was no way for mankind to return and form a relationship
with God, only by a permit or grant from Him, accompanied with the specified
conditions. I have now traced the subject, to the place where I can with
propriety introduce the holy priesthood.

I have already shown, that it was possible for man to receive information
concerning the plan of salvation, but at the same time be destitute of the
proper authority to reap the benefits of it. Therefore, the thing lacking,
which was absolutely necessary, was the permit from heaven; or in other words,
the priesthood -- which was given to Adam.

This priesthood, as I have before observed, is the principle that binds the
hosts of heaven together, is the commission given to angels, and is the
necessary authority in the kingdom of God; and indeed, virtually speaking,
when this priesthood was given, the kingdom was given: for it is the authority
by which all the officers are consecrated, or the kingdom organized, and the
ordinances administered. When I speak of the kingdom of God on earth, I mean
to be understood as speaking of it, as being synonymous with the church
militant.

Now the reader is to understand, that this kingdom was organized on earth
expressly for the benefit of the fallen race of mankind, and all those who are
legally adopted into it, and are faithful to God during the short period of
their existence in time, will not only be under the immediate protection

of God; but will heir an inheritance in heaven, and fully regain all that was
lost by the fall; so that our painful course through time, and the serious
afflictions that flesh is heir to, in the end will be no detriment to us, but
rather, as the apostle says: "..." Again, it is
incompatible with the Lord's mode of dealing with the human family, to be
present himself and act the part of a priest on earth to administer the
ordinances that appertain to His kingdom, or to station His angels here for
that purpose; hence, He elected good men and conferred the priesthood upon
them, that they might administer the ordinances and adopt souls into this
kingdom. Thus the Lord deputized righteous men to do his work in his name. The
following declaration of the apostle, abundantly sustains this idea. "..." *

Moses and the prophet XXSCRIP, connect the priesthood and a covenant together;
speaking of the priesthood conferred upon Aaron and his Sons, they call it a
covenant of priesthood."..." a dispensation, and a
covenant are inseparably connected, (I mean a general dispensation that is
given for the purpose of building up the kingdom.) Therefore, if the
priesthood was given to Aaron, a covenant was made, and a dispensation given
to him.

Now when we consider that God is the same unchangeable being in all ages of
the world, and that He has but one mode of saving men, we cannot dispute that
His kingdom was established on earth in as early an age of the world, as that
in which Adam lived. Yet I admit, there is no positive evidence that Adam had
this priesthood; but there is an abundance of circumstantial, as will be seen
from the following.

The first evidence, that the priesthood was given to men in this age, I shall
examine, in the circumstance of Cain and Abel, offering a sacrifice as a type,
no doubt, alluding to, and conveying an idea of the great sacrifice of the Son
of God. Moses gives the following account of this offering: "..." *

This not only shows, that Adam and his sons had a knowledge of the promised
Saviour and of the atonement; but, that some one was in possession of the
priesthood at this, period. But it is very evident, that it was given to Adam,
and he conferred it upon his sons; and even if Cain and Abel did not have it,
I am certain the person who administered at the alter did; for it is an
established principle in the economy of God, that no one has a legal right to
administer the ordinances of his kingdom, except he be qualified with the
priesthood; not even a sacrifice-offering excepted. To establish this, I refer
the reader to the circumstance of Saul, king of Israel, offering a sacrifice
at Gilgal, when he had no authority to do it. * This was a grievous offence in
the sight of God, so much so, that he rent the kingdom from him and his
posterity, and gave it to David. The apostle says: "..." † Moses strictly
forbade any one of the Israelites to administer at the altar, but those who
had the priesthood.

The foregoing sufficiently establishes the idea, that the priesthood was given
to man almost from the beginning; but it will be remembered, that he retained
it only by obedience to the commandments of God: for it is His kingdom, and He
will not keep in office those who disobey Him; hence, when Cain and others
transgressed, He took it from them. But I will now bring forward another train
of evidence; therefore, I solicit the reader to divest himself of all
prejudice, and critically examine it with me.

I have before remarked, that the fall of man produced an entire change in his
estate, and that all mankind, before obedience to the principles of
righteousness, are foreigners from God; and that His kingdom was established
on earth, in order that they might return and form an allegiance with Him;
hence, as soon as the priesthood was given, and the kingdom established, and
men began to increase upon the earth, those who belonged to the kingdom of
God, were distinguished from those who rejected it, by the appellation of the
"..." or "..."And it is possible, that Eve gave birth
to children before this priesthood was conferred upon Adam, (although, we have
nothing definite to establish such an idea;) but as soon as he received it, he
formed his allegiance with God, and become the head officer of the church or
kingdom on earth; hence, said she, when Cain was born, "..." thinking, no doubt,
that he would succeed his father in
the right of presiding over the church: moreover, that he would be numbered
with the "..." because he was born after they had renewed their
relationship with God. Cain however, murdered his brother Abel, in consequence
of which he was cursed, and excluded from the privileges of the priesthood;
therefore, Seth succeeded his father. And it appears, that the principal
object Moses had in view, in his very brief history of the world from the
creation down to Abraham, was to give the regular lineal descent and
succession of priests or patriarchs, who by virtue of the holy priesthood,
reigned as kings and priests, or presided in their day over the church.

Again, when we consider the frailty of the human mind, and the character of
satan, who invaded the earth, it is no more than reasonable for us to suppose,
that at a very early period there became two parties, which indeed was the
case. The "..." who reaped the benefits of the priesthood, and were
made the adopted children of God, in contradistinction to the wicked, (who
were called the "...") were termed the "..." This is certainly, a most excellent explanation of this
mysterious passage of scripture: "..." * This has been a difficult text for the
learned to comment upon. And some have indulged themselves in strange flights
of imagination, and enthusiastic speculation about the meaning of it, and have
supposed that the angels of heaven, had some mysterious commerce with the fair
sex of that age -- which is a great absurdity. All of this, is the affect of
the ignorance that exists in this our day with regard to the holy priesthood.

Even after the Antideluvian age, the people of the Lord, were called, "..."
although, the term; "..." was frequently used. The appellation of
"..." is often used in the XXSCRIP; for instance: "..." * The idea is, the
people of God met together and
satan protruded himself into their midst. The apostles also, frequently make
use of the term "..."

But before I leave the history of the priesthood in this age, I will again
introduce as positive evidence, to sustain the idea of the existence of the
priesthood on earth at this period, the following logical conclusions. First,
the Lord is the same in all ages of the world, and indeed from and to all
eternity. Secondly, his law, or the gospel, is the same invariable rule or
plan of salvation; therefore, it requires in all ages, the same principle of
authority to administer it. Thirdly, by the gospel life and immortality were
brought to light; and I am certain, if the bible is true, the Antideluvian
patriarchs understood these important principles. Fourthly, the precious
blessings, such as communing with God, as Enoch and others did, revelations,
administration of angels, faith, etc., etc., are enjoyed by those, who by virtue
of the priesthood are adopted into the family of God. Fifthly, there is but
one general order of priesthood, and that has existed from all eternity; for
the idea is held forth by the sacred writers, that Christ has been in
possession of it from before the foundation of the world, and as the kingdom
of God could not have been organized on earth without it; therefore as the
Lord's people of the age of which I now write, were in possession of the
kingdom and of the above mentioned blessings, it is established beyond
successful contradiction, that the Lord consecrated men to the office of the
priesthood soon after the fall. Being assured, in my own mind, that the
foregoing is sufficient to establish the position I have taken, I now continue
my history.

As I have before mentioned, there was a regular succession of kings, priests
or patriarchs, from Adam to Abraham, and it appears that during this age,
while the chosen or elect people of God, formed a separate or distinct people
by themselves, that it was highly displeasing to God, for them to intermix or
marry with the wicked: for it seems, that a violation of this rule, was one
reason why the Lord brought a flood upon the world, and destroyed all with the
exception of Noah and his family.

It is said that Noah was a preacher of righteousness, not of the ceremonial
law of Moses, for it was not then in existence; but the righteousness which is
of faith, or in other words, the gospel of Christ; and any evidence that the
gospel was preached in this early age, is proof that the priesthood existed on
earth at the same time.

In the preservation of Noah from destruction by the flood, the regular
succession of presiding priests was continued after it. He is a very prominent
man, in the history of these early times, and the bible gives him the
character of a prophet, and it also records the circumstance of his
administering at the alter, which certainly gives him the character of a
priest.

There is nothing in the history, of the elapse of time from Noah to Abraham,
that particularly attracts attention, only in exhibition of the fraility of
man; for it appears, there was a great falling away, or apostacy from God, and
a substitution of an idolatrous, in the place of the true worship. Also, the
building of the tower of Babel, which was very offensive to God: for which He
confounded the language that the human family then spoke, and scattered them
upon all the face of the earth.

I have now concluded the first division of my history; therefore, I close this
chapter, not however, without first assuring the reader, that the following
one contains matter of a very interesting character, and of importance to all
mankind.
